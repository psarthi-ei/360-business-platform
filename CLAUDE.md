# ElevateBusiness 360¬∞ Platform - Complete Project Context

## üöÄ CURRENT ACTIVE WORK
**Current Todos**: Always check `/TODO.md` for persistent todo list across sessions
**Session Tracking**: Use TodoWrite tool for real-time progress within sessions

**üìù UPDATED CONTEXT BUILDING**: New 2-step approach replaces old "get full context first" command
- More structured and comprehensive than previous ad-hoc context building
- Ensures consistent project understanding across all sessions

## üïê **SESSION INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL**

### **2-STEP MANDATORY SESSION SETUP**
**Every new session MUST follow this exact sequence:**

**Quick Session Start Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ `date` command (verify current timeline context)
2. ‚úÖ Read 5 key documents (complete project understanding)
3. ‚úÖ Ready for development work with full context

### **STEP 1: MANDATORY DATE VERIFICATION**
**ALWAYS start every session by running the `date` command before any other actions.**

**Example Session Start:**
```bash
# First command in every session - MANDATORY
date
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Ensures accurate project timeline tracking
- Prevents incorrect date references in documentation
- Validates project milestone calculations  
- Maintains consistency across all document updates

**Project Timeline Reference (Auto-Update After Date Check):**
- **Project Started**: August 27, 2025
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 (Backend Integration) 
- **Phase 1 Completed**: September 25, 2025
- **Phase 2 Target**: October-December 2025
- **MVP Target**: January 2026

**After Date Verification Protocol:**
1. Update any "Last Updated" fields with accurate system date
2. Cross-reference milestone dates with current timeline
3. Calculate actual project days elapsed since Aug 27, 2025
4. Proceed with development tasks using verified date context
5. Flag any timeline discrepancies immediately

## üìö **DOCUMENTATION-BASED CONTEXT BUILDING**

### **STEP 2: MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION CONTEXT BUILDING**
**After date verification, ALWAYS read the 5 key documents for complete project context.**

**Documentation Navigation:**
```bash
# Start with master navigation document
Read: /docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
```

**üîë KEY DOCUMENTS - ESSENTIAL FOR CONTEXT (Read in Order):**
1. **PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md** - What we're building & why (business requirements, MVP scope)
2. **BUSINESS_PROCESSES.md** - How textile business works (8-stage workflow, automated conversion)
3. **UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Platform architecture & zero code duplication 
4. **MOBILE_UX_V2_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Current mobile transformation plan (Phase 2 ready)
5. **USE_CASES_MASTER.md** - Implementation status & progress tracking (272 use cases)

**Why This Context Building Approach:**
- **Complete Understanding**: 5 documents provide full project comprehension
- **Current Status**: Real implementation progress vs outdated assumptions  
- **Business Logic**: Textile manufacturing domain knowledge essential for decisions
- **Architecture Clarity**: Universal voice/search system and shared business logic
- **Immediate Priorities**: Phase-by-phase mobile transformation ready to execute

**Context Building Verification:**
‚úÖ Understand the 8-stage textile business workflow  
‚úÖ Know the automated lead-to-customer conversion system  
‚úÖ Grasp the universal architecture with zero code duplication  
‚úÖ Identify current Mobile UX V2 phase status (Phase 2: Enhanced Search Results)  
‚úÖ Review implementation progress (Foundation modules 28-38% complete)

## ‚ö° **SESSION PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT**

### **OPTIMAL WORKFLOW: `/clear` + `/resume` Every 2-3 Hours**
**Problem:** Claude's context window fills up during long sessions, causing slower responses and lost context

**SOLUTION: Proactive Context Management**
```bash
# Every 2-3 hours or at natural break points
/clear
/resume
```

### **When to Use `/clear` + `/resume`**

**Performance Indicators (Don't Wait for These):**
- Claude starts responding slowly
- Re-reading files already examined  
- Asking about things just discussed
- Responses become less focused/coherent

**Proactive Triggers (Recommended):**
- **Every 2-3 hours** of active coding
- **After 50-100 message exchanges**
- **Before starting new major features/modules**
- **After completing significant todo lists**
- **When switching between different parts of codebase**
- **After complex debugging sessions**

### **Why This Works**
- **`/clear`**: Completely resets context window, removes conversation history weight
- **`/resume`**: Provides curated, high-quality project context without performance overhead
- **Result**: Maximum speed + essential continuity

### **Best Practice**
**Don't wait for slowdown** - use `/clear` + `/resume` proactively at natural break points. Prevention is better than pushing through degraded performance.

### **Claude's Reminder Behavior**
**Claude will proactively suggest `/clear` + `/resume` when:**
- Noticing own performance degradation (re-reading files, asking about recent topics)
- At natural workflow break points (completing major tasks, switching modules)
- After 2-3 hours of continuous coding work
- Before starting complex tasks that need fresh context

**Reminder Style:**
- **Brief and helpful**: "Might be a good time for `/clear` + `/resume`"
- **Context-aware**: Only when it genuinely makes sense for workflow
- **Non-intrusive**: Won't interrupt urgent debugging or mid-task work
- **Your choice**: Final decision on timing always yours

## üîç **DEVELOPMENT VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**

### **CRITICAL: Always Verify Compilation State**
**Problem:** Frequently declaring "everything is fine" when actual compilation errors exist in browser

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:**
1. **ALWAYS check npm start output via BashOutput after ANY code change**
2. **Browser compilation errors = source of truth, not file-level analysis**
3. **Never declare "fixed" or "working" without verifying compilation succeeds**
4. **TypeScript cache issues can show false positives - always verify with fresh output**
5. **ESLint + TypeScript + Webpack all run together - check the combined result**

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check real-time compilation status
BashOutput tool with current npm start process

# If needed, restart compilation
pkill -f "npm start"
npm start
```

**Rule:** File looks correct ‚â† Compilation succeeds. Always verify the actual build state.

### **CRITICAL: TypeScript `any` Type Ban**
**Problem:** Using `any` types leads to massive refactoring marathons when fixing type safety issues

**MANDATORY TYPESCRIPT RULES:**
1. **NEVER use `any` type in new code - always define proper business domain types**
2. **Use existing ActionParams union type system for voice command parameters**
3. **Create specific interfaces for new business domains (e.g., PaymentParams, OrderParams)**
4. **Use proper type guards with discriminated unions for parameter handling**
5. **Vercel treats ESLint warnings as errors - `any` types will break deployment**

**Approved Type Patterns:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Business domain-specific types
interface SetPriorityParams {
  leadId: string;
  priority: 'hot' | 'warm' | 'cold';
}

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Union type with fallback
export type ActionParams = 
  | SetPriorityParams
  | AddNewLeadParams
  | Record<string, unknown>; // fallback only

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Proper type guards
if (params && 'leadId' in params) {
  const priorityParams = params as SetPriorityParams;
  handlePriorityChange(priorityParams.leadId, priorityParams.priority);
}

// ‚ùå BAD: Generic any types
function handleAction(actionType: string, params?: any) // NEVER DO THIS
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents deployment failures (Vercel treats warnings as errors)
- Maintains type safety across the entire codebase
- Avoids massive refactoring sessions when fixing type issues
- Ensures proper IntelliSense and developer experience
