# ElevateBusiness 360¬∞ Platform - Complete Project Context

## üöÄ CURRENT ACTIVE WORK
**Current Todos**: Always check `/TODO.md` for persistent todo list across sessions
**Session Tracking**: Use TodoWrite tool for real-time progress within sessions

## üïê **SESSION INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL**

### **MANDATORY FIRST STEP - DATE VERIFICATION**
**ALWAYS start every session by running the `date` command before any other actions.**

**Example Session Start:**
```bash
# First command in every session - MANDATORY
date
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Ensures accurate project timeline tracking
- Prevents incorrect date references in documentation
- Validates project milestone calculations  
- Maintains consistency across all document updates

**Project Timeline Reference (Auto-Update After Date Check):**
- **Project Started**: August 27, 2025
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 (Backend Integration) 
- **Phase 1 Completed**: September 25, 2025
- **Phase 2 Target**: October-December 2025
- **MVP Target**: January 2026

**After Date Verification Protocol:**
1. Update any "Last Updated" fields with accurate system date
2. Cross-reference milestone dates with current timeline
3. Calculate actual project days elapsed since Aug 27, 2025
4. Proceed with development tasks using verified date context
5. Flag any timeline discrepancies immediately
