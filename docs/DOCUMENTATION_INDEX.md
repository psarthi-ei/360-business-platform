## Overview
**üöÄ READ THIS FIRST in every new session!** 

This is the master navigation document that guides you to all project information. Whether you're Claude starting a new session, a team member joining the project, or anyone needing to understand the 360¬∞ Business Platform, always begin here.

**Purpose**: Central hub that explains where every piece of information lives and how to navigate the complete project documentation system.

## **ü§ñ For Claude AI - New Session Setup**

**Quick Context Command**: 
```
"Get full context first - read docs and analyze codebase"
```

**What this does**:
1. **Reads all documentation** in /docs/ folder to understand business context, requirements, and current progress
2. **Analyzes current codebase structure** to understand technical implementation, patterns, and architecture  
3. **Checks current project status** including test failures, recent changes, and immediate priorities
4. **Provides complete context summary** before starting any development work

**Why this matters**: Code evolves constantly, so static documentation becomes outdated. This approach ensures you always get the most current understanding of both business requirements (from docs) and technical reality (from code analysis).

## **CLEAR SCOPE DEFINITION - WHERE TO PUT WHAT**

### **Information Category Mapping**

| **What You Want to Document** | **Goes In** | **Why** |
|---|---|---|
| **Daily Development Progress (features built, challenges, motivation)** | PROGRESS_LOG.md | Personal daily tracking |
| **Visual Design Philosophy & Standards** | DESIGN_SYSTEM.md | Design principles and patterns |
| **Dashboard Technical Implementation** | DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md | UI component architecture |

### **Common Confusion - Examples**

‚ùå **WRONG**: Adding HomePage component details to PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md  
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: HomePage goes in PROGRESS_LOG.md (what was built) + DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md (component specs)

‚ùå **WRONG**: Dashboard navigation patterns in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md  
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: Navigation implementation in DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md + visual design principles in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

‚ùå **WRONG**: Business workflow logic in DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md  
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: Business processes belong in BUSINESS_PROCESSES.md

‚ùå **WRONG**: 3-level dashboard architecture in PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md  
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: Technical architecture in DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md + business justification in PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md

### **Quick Decision Guide**

**Ask yourself**: 
1. **Is it about business processes?** ‚Üí BUSINESS_PROCESSES.md
2. **Is it dashboard/UI implementation?** ‚Üí DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md
3. **Is it a technology decision?** ‚Üí TECHNICAL_STRATEGY.md
4. **Is it visual design philosophy?** ‚Üí DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
5. **Is it daily progress?** ‚Üí PROGRESS_LOG.md
6. **Is it setup instructions?** ‚Üí DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
7. **Is it what features to build?** ‚Üí PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md
8. **Is it working style/learning approach?** ‚Üí COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md
9. **Is it code patterns/standards?** ‚Üí CODING_STANDARDS.md
10. **Is it project overview?** ‚Üí README.md

### **Keep It Simple Rule**
- **Each document = Single clear purpose**
- **No duplicate information across documents**
- **When in doubt, ask: "What is this information FOR?"**

## **DOCUMENT DISTINCTIONS - Detailed Clarification**

### **Technical Documents (WHY vs HOW vs WHAT)**

#### **TECHNICAL_STRATEGY.md = WHY** 
**Purpose**: Architecture decisions and their rationale
**Contains**:
- Why React PWA over native app
- Why Node.js over Python
- Why single domain over subdomains
- Why localStorage auth for MVP vs full backend

- How to deploy to production
- Troubleshooting steps

**Example**: "Run `npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript` to set up the project"

#### **CODING_STANDARDS.md = HOW**
**Purpose**: Code patterns and standards to follow
**Contains**:
- What naming conventions to use (`camelCase` vs `PascalCase`)
- What function syntax to prefer (regular functions vs arrow functions)
- What code organization patterns to follow
- What commenting style to use

**Example**: "Use `function calculateTotal()` instead of `const calculateTotal = () =>`"

### **Business Documents (WHAT vs HOW vs WHY)**

#### **PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md = WHAT**
**Purpose**: Feature specifications and scope
**Contains**:
- What features to build (12 MVP modules)
- What voice commands to support

**Purpose**: Design decisions and their rationale
**Contains**:
- Why mobile-first design for textile manufacturers
- Why certain color schemes for business context
- Why specific navigation patterns
- Why certain information architecture

**Example**: "We use card-based layout because textile manufacturers need to quickly scan multiple leads"

## Documentation Quality Guidelines

### **Keep It Simple**
- Use clear, non-technical language when possible
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"

### **Java Developer Friendly**
- Use Java analogies and comparisons
- Explain web concepts in terms of familiar Java patterns
- Avoid JavaScript shorthand in examples

### **Business Context**
- Always use textile manufacturing examples
- Reference Gujarat, Surat, Ahmedabad markets
- Include Gujarati/Hindi terminology where relevant

### **Maintain Consistency**
- Follow established patterns across all documentation
- Use same terminology and examples throughout
- Keep formatting and structure consistent

---

## Success Indicators

### **Good Documentation Habits**
- ‚úÖ Daily progress log entries (consistency)
- ‚úÖ Clear commit messages that match documentation
- ‚úÖ Regular updates when completing milestones
- ‚úÖ Documentation stays aligned with actual development

### **Documentation Health Check**
- Does each file serve its intended purpose?
- Are update schedules being followed?
- Is information consistent across files?
- Can a new developer understand the project from docs alone?
