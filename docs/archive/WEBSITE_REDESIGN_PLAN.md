### **Phase 4: Frontend Architecture Restructuring (Week 4)**

#### **Frontend Folder Restructuring Strategy:**

**Architectural Decision**: Move website components to dedicated `/website` folder while keeping platform components in existing `/components` structure.

**Current Challenge**: Website and platform components mixed together, making deployment boundaries unclear.

**Solution - Simplified Restructuring**:
```
frontend/src/
├── website/                   # NEW - Website components only
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── HomePage.tsx              # Move from /components/
│   │   ├── PlatformShowcase.tsx      # Move from /components/
│   │   ├── ServicesHub.tsx           # Create new
│   │   ├── BlogHome.tsx              # Create new
│   │   ├── AboutPage.tsx             # Create new
│   │   └── ContactPage.tsx           # Create new
│   ├── styles/
│   │   ├── HomePage.module.css       # Move from /styles/
│   │   └── PlatformShowcase.module.css # Move from /styles/
│   └── content/
│       └── services/                 # Move from /src/content/
│
├── components/                # UNCHANGED - Platform + shared components
│   ├── ProductHeader.tsx             # Shared component (stays)
│   ├── Authentication.tsx            # Shared component (stays)
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx                 # Platform component
│   ├── LeadManagement.tsx            # Platform component
│   └── [all other platform components remain here]
│
└── [styles/, contexts/, utils/ remain unchanged]
```

**Implementation Benefits**:
- **Clear Deployment Boundaries**: Vercel = `/website` + shared, GCP = `/components` + shared
- **Minimal Disruption**: Only ~6 website files need moving vs restructuring everything
- **Deployment Optimization**: Each target includes only relevant components
- **Code Sharing**: ProductHeader, Authentication remain shared in `/components`

**Migration Steps**:
1. Create `/src/website/components/` and `/src/website/styles/` folders
2. Move HomePage.tsx and PlatformShowcase.tsx to website folder
3. Move content folder to `/src/website/content/`
4. Update import statements in App.tsx
5. Create placeholder website components (ServicesHub, BlogHome, etc.)
6. Test both website and platform functionality

**Deployment Architecture Alignment**:
- **Website Deployment (Vercel)**: Includes `/website` + shared components
- **Platform Deployment (GCP)**: Includes `/components` + shared components  
- **Single Codebase**: Environment-based builds determine which components to include
- **Build Optimization**: Each deployment gets only relevant code

### **Phase 5: React Component Integration (Week 5)**

#### **Website Component Development:**
1. **Homepage Component Updates**
   - Enhance existing HomePage.tsx with product focus
   - Integrate blog preview section
   - Add consulting services mention

2. **New Page Components**
   - ProductShowcase.tsx (platform overview)
   - ConsultingServices.tsx (existing content migration)
   - BlogList.tsx (365 Days stories)
   - AboutUs.tsx (complete rewrite)

3. **Navigation Updates**
   - Header redesign with product-first hierarchy
   - Mobile-friendly navigation
   - Clear visual hierarchy

#### **Content Management System:**

### **🚨 URGENT ISSUE: Header Inconsistency Problem**

**Critical UX Issue Discovered:**
- **Homepage & Website Pages**: Use full navigation header from HomePage.tsx (Services, Blog, About, Contact)
- **Platform Pages**: Use minimal ProductHeader.tsx (just logo + context navigation + dropdown)
- **User Impact**: Jarring navigation inconsistency when moving between website and platform sections

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
App.tsx Conditional Logic:
{currentScreen !== 'homepage' && (
  <ProductHeader ... />
)}

Result:
