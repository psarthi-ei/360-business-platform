## Step-by-Step Development Commands

### Step 1: Create React PWA Application
**Date**: Sep 3, 2025  
**Goal**: Set up React TypeScript app with PWA capabilities

**Commands to run**:

# Create React app with TypeScript template
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install PWA dependencies
npm install workbox-webpack-plugin

- No app store friction for textile manufacturers
- Works on any phone with browser
- Easy to demo ("just click this link")

### Decision 2: Material-UI vs Custom CSS
**Date**: Sep 3, 2025  
**Decision**: Material-UI  
**Reason**:
- Professional look out of the box

## Commands Reference

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Install new package
npm install package-name
```

### Git Commands for Progress Tracking
```bash
# Add and commit progress
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Description of what was built"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

## File Organization Standards

### Component Naming
- **PascalCase** for components: `LeadManagement.tsx`
- **camelCase** for functions: `createNewLead()`
- **kebab-case** for files: `lead-management.css`

### Folder Structure
- `/components` - Reusable UI pieces
- `/pages` - Full screen components  
- `/services` - API and external integrations
- `/utils` - Helper functions and constants

---

## Notes for Future Development

### Key Principles
1. **Document every step** - Future reference and onboarding
2. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits with clear messages
3. **Mobile-first design** - Textile manufacturers use phones
4. **Keep it simple** - Avoid over-engineering, focus on working features

### Performance Considerations
- **Bundle size** - Keep initial load under 500KB
- **Voice commands** - Cache common phrases offline
- **Images** - Optimize all images for mobile data usage
- **Offline capability** - Core features work without internet

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Node.js Issues
```bash
# Clear npm cache if installation fails
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### React Development Issues
```bash
# If development server won't start
npm start -- --reset-cache

# If TypeScript errors are confusing
npm run build
# Check build output for clearer error messages
```
