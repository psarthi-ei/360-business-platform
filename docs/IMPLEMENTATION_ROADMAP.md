## **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **🎯 IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY: UI + MOCK DATA ONLY**

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**: All sub-phases focus exclusively on **UI implementation with mock data presentation**. No complex business logic, service layers, or cross-module automation should be created.

**✅ WHAT TO IMPLEMENT:**
- Professional UI components matching Visual Design Specification
- **100% Design System Token Usage** (MANDATORY - NO hardcoded values)
- Mock data integration and display logic
- Client-side filtering, grouping, and basic interactions
- Responsive styling and mobile-first design
- Professional B2B appearance and touch-friendly interfaces

**❌ WHAT NOT TO IMPLEMENT:**
- Complex business logic engines or service layers
- Real-time inventory validation or cross-module synchronization
- Automatic entity creation or business rule automation
- Backend integration or complex workflow orchestration

### **Core Principles**
1. **Update Existing Systems**: Never create new files when existing patterns work
2. **Design System Compliance**: 100% design system token usage - NO hardcoded values (fonts, colors, spacing)
3. **Component Pattern Compliance**: Follow COMPONENT_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md for templates, CSS variables, and scroll integration
4. **Visual Design Compliance**: 100% adherence to Visual Design Specification
5. **Role-Based Navigation**: Implement default tab assignments and access control per user role (Supervisor/Operator/QC Inspector/Store)
6. **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly, factory floor optimized interface with voice integration hooks
7. **Professional Quality**: Production-ready B2B application
8. **UI Excellence**: Focus on presenting mock data beautifully and professionally

### **Git Workflow**
- Commit after each sub-phase: `MOBILE UX V3 - SUB-PHASE [X.Y]: [Description]`
- Mandatory rollback points for safety
- Clean commit history with descriptive messages

### **Component File Structure Updates for 5-Tab Production**

**Current Component Architecture** (4-tab):
```
Production.tsx (main shell)
├── WorkOrderPlanning.tsx (Plan tab)
├── LiveProductionTracking.tsx (Active tab)  
├── QualityControlManagement.tsx (QC tab)
└── DeliveryFulfillment.tsx (Ready tab)
```

**New Component Architecture** (5-tab):
```
Production.tsx (updated shell - 5 tabs)
├── OrdersTab.tsx (Orders tab - NEW/renamed from WorkOrderPlanning)
├── WorkOrderTab.tsx (WO tab - NEW split from LiveProductionTracking)
├── MachinesTab.tsx (Machines tab - NEW split from LiveProductionTracking)  
├── QualityControlManagement.tsx (QC tab - UPDATED workflow)
└── DeliveryFulfillment.tsx (Ready tab - UPDATED dispatch process)
```

**Required File Changes**:
- **Production.tsx**: Update tab types, routing, filters, state management for 5-tab structure
- **WorkOrderPlanning.tsx** → **OrdersTab.tsx**: Rename and update for Sales Order management workflow
- **LiveProductionTracking.tsx**: Split functionality between WorkOrderTab.tsx (planning view) and MachinesTab.tsx (operator view)
- **QualityControlManagement.tsx**: Update for pass/rework QC workflow with photo evidence
- **DeliveryFulfillment.tsx**: Update for dispatch workflow with automatic invoice generation
- **productionMockData.ts**: Update mock data structure for new 5-tab workflow and role-based navigation

### **Validation Requirements**
- TypeScript compliance (zero `any` types)
- Build verification after each phase
- **MANDATORY Design System Token Audit**: Zero hardcoded fonts, colors, spacing values
- **Component Pattern Validation**: Follow COMPONENT_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md checklist for templates and integration
- **Role-Based Navigation Testing**: Verify default tab assignments and role-specific access control
- Mobile responsiveness testing with factory floor optimization
- Design system compliance verification (use `grep` to check for hardcoded values)
