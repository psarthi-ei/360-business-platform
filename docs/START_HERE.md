## **CLEAR SCOPE DEFINITION - WHERE TO PUT WHAT**

### **Information Category Mapping**

| **What You Want to Document** | **Goes In** | **Why** |
|---|---|---|
| **Daily Development Progress (features built, challenges, motivation)** | PROGRESS_LOG.md | Personal daily tracking |
| **Visual Design Patterns (Colors, Layouts)** | UI_UX_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md | Design standards |
| **Tech Decisions (PWA vs App, Auth Strategy)** | TECHNICAL_STRATEGY.md | Architecture choices |
| **Business Process (Lead→Quote→Order)** | BUSINESS_FLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md | Industry workflows |
| **Code Commands & Setup Steps** | DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md | How-to instructions |
| **Feature Requirements (Voice Commands)** | BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md | What to build |
| **Working Style & Learning Approach** | COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md | Our collaboration methods |
| **Project Status (MVP ready, beta launch)** | README.md | Public overview |

### **Common Confusion - Examples**

❌ **WRONG**: Adding HomePage component details to BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md  
✅ **RIGHT**: HomePage goes in PROGRESS_LOG.md (what was built) + UI_UX_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md (design patterns)

❌ **WRONG**: Authentication code examples in UI_UX_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md  
✅ **RIGHT**: Auth strategy in TECHNICAL_STRATEGY.md + setup steps in DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md

❌ **WRONG**: Textile business workflow in TECHNICAL_STRATEGY.md  
✅ **RIGHT**: Business processes belong in BUSINESS_FLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md

### **Quick Decision Guide**

**Ask yourself**: 
1. **Is it about business processes?** → BUSINESS_FLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md
2. **Is it a technology decision?** → TECHNICAL_STRATEGY.md
3. **Is it visual/UI related?** → UI_UX_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md
4. **Is it daily progress?** → PROGRESS_LOG.md
5. **Is it setup instructions?** → DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
6. **Is it what features to build?** → BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md
7. **Is it working style/learning approach?** → COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md
8. **Is it code patterns/standards?** → CODING_STYLE_GUIDE.md
9. **Is it project overview?** → README.md

### **Keep It Simple Rule**
- **Each document = Single clear purpose**
- **No duplicate information across documents**
- **When in doubt, ask: "What is this information FOR?"**

## Documentation Quality Guidelines

### **Keep It Simple**
- Use clear, non-technical language when possible
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"

### **Java Developer Friendly**
- Use Java analogies and comparisons
- Explain web concepts in terms of familiar Java patterns
- Avoid JavaScript shorthand in examples

### **Business Context**
- Always use textile manufacturing examples
- Reference Gujarat, Surat, Ahmedabad markets
- Include Gujarati/Hindi terminology where relevant

### **Maintain Consistency**
- Follow established patterns across all documentation
- Use same terminology and examples throughout
- Keep formatting and structure consistent

---

## Success Indicators

### **Good Documentation Habits**
- ✅ Daily progress log entries (consistency)
- ✅ Clear commit messages that match documentation
- ✅ Regular updates when completing milestones
- ✅ Documentation stays aligned with actual development

### **Documentation Health Check**
- Does each file serve its intended purpose?
- Are update schedules being followed?
- Is information consistent across files?
- Can a new developer understand the project from docs alone?
