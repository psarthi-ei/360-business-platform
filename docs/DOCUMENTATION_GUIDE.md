## Documentation Quality Guidelines

### **Keep It Simple**
- Use clear, non-technical language when possible
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"

### **Java Developer Friendly**
- Use Java analogies and comparisons
- Explain web concepts in terms of familiar Java patterns
- Avoid JavaScript shorthand in examples

### **Business Context**
- Always use textile manufacturing examples
- Reference Gujarat, Surat, Ahmedabad markets
- Include Gujarati/Hindi terminology where relevant

### **Maintain Consistency**
- Follow established patterns across all documentation
- Use same terminology and examples throughout
- Keep formatting and structure consistent

---

## Success Indicators

### **Good Documentation Habits**
- ‚úÖ Daily progress log entries (consistency)
- ‚úÖ Clear commit messages that match documentation
- ‚úÖ Regular updates when completing milestones
- ‚úÖ Documentation stays aligned with actual development

### **Documentation Health Check**
- Does each file serve its intended purpose?
- Are update schedules being followed?
- Is information consistent across files?
- Can a new developer understand the project from docs alone?
