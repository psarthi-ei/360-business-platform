    <div className={styles.tabNavigationHeader}>
      <h2>üîÑ Textile Business Pipeline</h2>
      <button onClick={onClose}>‚úï</button>
    </div>
    
    {/* Tab bar with fade gradients */}

      <div className={styles.tabBar}>
        {/* Tabs with scroll detection */}
      </div>
      {/* Conditional fade gradients */}
    </div>
    
    {/* Content with unified card */}
    <div className={styles.contentArea}>
      <div className={styles.unifiedCard}>
        {/* Key Stats section */}

## 3-Level Data Pattern Specifications

### **CRITICAL FRAMEWORK CORRECTION**
**Issue Identified**: Previous implementation incorrectly duplicated information across levels, treating Level 2 as another stats display instead of module selector.

**Corrected Framework**: Each level serves distinct purpose with unique data patterns:

### Level 1: Process Cards (Business Health Overview)
**Purpose**: Executive decision-making insights and strategic business health assessment  
**Data Focus**: Business intelligence, trends, and health indicators (NOT detailed counts)

#### Example Data Patterns for Process Cards

**üî• LEAD PIPELINE Card:**
```
Business Health: "Pipeline Strong" / "Needs Attention"
Key Insight: "3 hot leads worth ‚Çπ2.4L ready for quotes"  
Trend: "‚Üó 20% more leads this month"
Next Action: "Follow up with 2 overdue leads"
Smart Link: "Convert 3 hot leads ‚Üí Quotations"
```

**üìã QUOTATIONS Card:**
```
Business Health: "Quote Conversion: 65%" 
Key Insight: "‚Çπ4.2L in pending approvals"
Trend: "‚Üó Faster quote turnaround this week"  
Next Action: "2 quotes expiring tomorrow"
Smart Link: "‚Çπ2.4L awaiting payment ‚Üí Payments"
```

**üí∞ PAYMENTS Card:**
```
Business Health: "Cash Flow: Healthy"
Key Insight: "‚Çπ1.8L advance payments overdue"
Trend: "‚Üí Collection rate stable at 85%"
Next Action: "Chase 3 overdue payments"  
Smart Link: "Payment received ‚Üí Production"
```

### Level 2: Tab Navigation (Module Selector Interface)
**Purpose**: Help users choose the right tool/module for their specific task  
**Data Focus**: Module-specific overview and capability description (NOT duplicate stats)

#### Example Tab Structures by Process Area

**üî• LEAD PIPELINE Tabs:**
```
Tab 1: Lead Management ‚úÖ Live
- Quick Stats: "12 active leads ‚Ä¢ 4 hot ‚Ä¢ 3 need follow-up"
- Module Purpose: "Manage lead lifecycle and conversions" 
- Key Actions: "Add leads, update status, schedule follow-ups"

Tab 2: CRM - Prospect View ‚úÖ Live
- Quick Stats: "18 prospects ‚Ä¢ 6 companies ‚Ä¢ 3 repeat customers"
- Module Purpose: "360¬∞ customer relationship management"
- Key Actions: "View customer history, manage relationships"

Tab 3: Lead Analytics ‚ùå Coming Soon
- Module Purpose: "Lead performance analysis and forecasting"
- Features: "Conversion insights and performance metrics"

Tab 4: [Future Module] ‚ùå Coming Soon
```

**üìã QUOTATIONS Tabs:**

### Level 3: Module Content (Full Operational Interface)
**Purpose**: Complete CRUD operations and detailed data management for selected module  
**Data Focus**: Full operational data with all functionality

#### Example Module Content Patterns

**Lead Management Module (Level 3):**
```
- Complete lead list with all details and status
- Advanced filtering: hot/warm/cold, source, date range
- Full lead forms for creating and editing
- Activity history and notes for each lead
- Export capabilities (PDF, Excel)  
- Bulk operations and lead assignment
- Integration with calling and messaging
```

### Key Principles for Data Pattern Implementation

1. **No Information Duplication**: Each level shows unique information serving different purposes
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information detail increases from Level 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3
3. **Context-Appropriate**: Data matches the decision-making level of each interface
4. **Module-Centric Level 2**: Tab navigation is module selector, not filtered stats display
5. **Business Health Focus**: Level 1 shows strategic insights, not operational counts

## Navigation Framework Specification

### User Flow Patterns
The navigation system supports three distinct user journeys based on textile manufacturing workflows:

**1. Executive Decision Flow**:
```
Dashboard Overview ‚Üí Identify Business Issue ‚Üí Drill into Process Area ‚Üí Access Module
Example: Business health shows payment issues ‚Üí Click Payment card ‚Üí Open Collections module
```

**2. Process Management Flow**:  
```
Process Card ‚Üí Check Health Status ‚Üí Navigate to Related Process ‚Üí Take Action
Example: Production card shows material shortage ‚Üí Follow smart link to Inventory ‚Üí Order materials
```

**3. Operational Work Flow**:
```
Module Interface ‚Üí Complete Tasks ‚Üí Switch Modules ‚Üí Return to Process View  
Example: Stock Management ‚Üí Update inventory ‚Üí Switch to Procurement tab ‚Üí Return to dashboard
```

### Navigation Hierarchy
```
Level 1: Dashboard (Overview)
    ‚Üì Click Process Card
Level 2: Module Interface (Tab Navigation)
    ‚Üì Click Specific Tab  
Level 3: Module Functionality (Full Operations)
    ‚Üì Return/Navigate
Back to Level 1 or 2
```

### Cross-Process Navigation Requirements
```
Smart Context Links (Automated):
- Lead Pipeline ‚Üí "3 leads ready for quotes" ‚Üí Quotations module
- Quotations ‚Üí "‚Çπ2.4L awaiting payment" ‚Üí Advance Payments module  
- Payments ‚Üí "Payment received, start production" ‚Üí Production module
- Production ‚Üí "Materials needed" ‚Üí Inventory module
- Inventory ‚Üí "Stock ready for dispatch" ‚Üí Fulfillment module
- Fulfillment ‚Üí "Delivery feedback needed" ‚Üí Customer module
- Customers ‚Üí "Repeat opportunities" ‚Üí Lead Pipeline module

Navigation Rules:
1. Smart links only appear when relevant data conditions are met
2. Context is preserved when navigating between processes
3. Users can always return to previous level
4. Process relationships are visually indicated with arrows and suggestions
```

#### Information Placement Rules

**Executive Level Data Placement**:
- **What Goes Here**: Cross-process KPIs, business health indicators, strategic metrics
- **What Doesn't**: Operational details, individual records, module-specific data
- **Display Rule**: Overview only, no editing capabilities

**Process Level Data Placement**:
- **What Goes Here**: Process-specific metrics, health status, smart context links
- **What Doesn't**: Individual record details, full module functionality  
- **Display Rule**: Summary view with navigation to detailed modules

**Module Level Data Placement**:
- **What Goes Here**: Complete operational data, full CRUD functionality, detailed records
- **What Doesn't**: Cross-process summaries, executive-level metrics
- **Display Rule**: Full functionality for specific business module

### User Action Framework

#### Action Restrictions by Level
```
Executive Dashboard:
‚úÖ Allowed: View, Navigate, Assess
‚ùå Restricted: Edit, Create, Delete, Operational tasks

Process Area Cards:  
‚úÖ Allowed: View, Navigate, Quick Actions (call/message)
‚ùå Restricted: Detailed editing, Record management

Module Interface:
‚úÖ Allowed: All operations (Full CRUD, Export, Advanced features)
‚ùå Restricted: Cross-process changes without proper workflow
```

#### Workflow Integration Requirements
```
Business Process Workflow Enforcement:
1. Lead ‚Üí Quote conversion must follow proper approval workflow
2. Quote ‚Üí Payment requires advance payment collection (30% minimum)
3. Payment ‚Üí Production requires work order creation
4. Production ‚Üí Quality requires quality control checkpoint
5. Quality ‚Üí Fulfillment requires delivery coordination
6. Fulfillment ‚Üí Customer requires feedback collection
7. Customer ‚Üí Analytics requires performance tracking

System Validation:
- Prevent workflow shortcuts that bypass business rules
- Require proper data completion before process advancement
- Maintain audit trail of process progression
- Alert users when workflow steps are missed
```
