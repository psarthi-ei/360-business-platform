## üî• **ACTIVE (Current Priority) - Unified Voice & Search Architecture**

### üéØ STRATEGIC PRIORITY: Major Architecture Refactoring
**Context**: Implementing unified voice and search architecture to eliminate code duplication and create single source of truth for voice/search behavior across platform.

#### Phase 1: Configuration System (20 mins) ‚è≥
**Status**: Ready to implement
- [ ] **Create `/src/config/platformConfig.ts`** - Simple global vs component-specific configuration
- [ ] **Create `/src/utils/scopeResolver.ts`** - Clean scope resolution functions  
- [ ] **Test configuration imports** - Verify TypeScript compilation and imports

#### Phase 2: Voice/Search Separation (30 mins) ‚è≥
**Status**: Ready after Phase 1
- [ ] **Remove FloatingVoiceAssistant from GlobalSearch.tsx** - Separate voice from search
- [ ] **Add universal FloatingVoiceAssistant to App.tsx** - Single voice instance
- [ ] **Test voice/search separation** - Verify search typing unchanged, voice works universally

#### Phase 3: Business Component Cleanup (40 mins) ‚è≥ 
**Status**: Ready after Phase 2
- [ ] **Remove duplicate voice components from 10+ business components**
  - Dashboard.tsx, LeadManagement.tsx, QuotationOrders.tsx, SalesOrders.tsx
  - Payments.tsx, Invoices.tsx, CustomerList.tsx, InventoryManagement.tsx
  - FulfillmentManagement.tsx, AnalyticsManagement.tsx
- [ ] **Test each component after cleanup** - Verify business logic unchanged

#### Phase 4: Pipeline Integration (20 mins) ‚è≥
**Status**: Ready after Phase 3
- [ ] **Verify Voice ‚Üí NLP ‚Üí Search pipeline** - Single voice, single search, single NLP
- [ ] **Test configuration behavior** - Global vs component-specific modes
- [ ] **Complete integration testing** - Voice search across all platform pages

#### Documentation & Safety ‚úÖ
- [x] **Created `/docs/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Complete architectural blueprint
- [x] **Phase-by-phase commit strategy** - Safe rollback at any point
- [x] **File-by-file change specifications** - Exact implementation details

## üìã **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

### Current 3-Tier Voice Architecture Status

#### ‚úÖ **Implemented Components**
- **FloatingVoiceAssistant (MASTER)** - Voice command intelligence & routing ‚úÖ
- **Dashboard (MIDDLE MANAGER)** - Navigation orchestration & business stage management ‚úÖ  
- **Components (SPECIALISTS)** - Business domain expertise & action execution ‚úÖ
- **Command Classification System** - COMMAND_CONTEXTS mapping ‚úÖ
- **Context-Aware Routing** - routeActionWithContext function ‚úÖ
- **Universal Action Handlers** - handleUniversalAction in Dashboard ‚úÖ

#### üîß **Integration Issues (Current Blockers)**
- **TypeScript Compilation Errors** - Multiple errors preventing app startup ‚ùå
- **Component-Dashboard Sync** - Business stage tracking disconnected ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Voice Command Testing** - Cannot test due to compilation errors ‚ùå

#### üìù **Architecture Documentation**
- **NLP_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md** - Has 3-tier section but needs enhancement ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Detailed Responsibility Matrix** - Missing clear role definitions ‚ùå
- **Information Flow Examples** - Need step-by-step scenarios ‚ùå

## üéØ **3-TIER VOICE ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **TIER 1: FloatingVoiceAssistant (MASTER) üé§**
**Role**: Traffic Controller - "Where should this voice command go?"
- **Owns**: Voice input processing, command classification, routing logic, context awareness
- **Does NOT Own**: Navigation functions, business logic, state management

### **TIER 2: Dashboard (MIDDLE MANAGER) üéØ** 
**Role**: Navigation System - "Which business module should handle this?"
- **Owns**: Page navigation, business stage tracking, component lifecycle, cross-page actions
- **Does NOT Own**: Voice processing, command classification, business-specific actions

### **TIER 3: Components (SPECIALISTS) ‚öôÔ∏è**
**Role**: Local Experts - "How do I execute this business action?"
- **Owns**: Business actions, domain logic, data management, UI behavior
- **Does NOT Own**: Voice processing, cross-page navigation, global state

## üéØ **SESSION MANAGEMENT NOTES**

### **Current Focus**: Fix Compilation + Voice Navigation
**Target**: Get app running and verify universal dashboard voice commands work from all pages
**Rationale**: Cannot test or develop further features until compilation errors are resolved

### **Current Session Tasks** (Synced with TodoWrite):
1. ‚úÖ **Created unified architecture document** - Complete refactoring blueprint
2. ‚úÖ **Updated TODO.md with unified architecture plan** - Phase-by-phase implementation  
3. ‚è≥ **Ready to implement Phase 1** - Configuration system creation (20 mins)
4. ‚è≥ **Ready for complete refactoring** - Single voice, single search, zero duplication
5. ‚è≥ **Architecture testing planned** - Voice ‚Üí NLP ‚Üí Search pipeline verification

### **Next Session Priorities**:
1. **Implement Phase 1** - Create configuration system (platformConfig.ts, scopeResolver.ts)
2. **Implement Phase 2** - Separate voice from search (remove embedded voice assistant)
3. **Implement Phase 3** - Clean business components (remove 10+ duplicate voice components)
4. **Implement Phase 4** - Test unified pipeline (voice ‚Üí NLP ‚Üí search ‚Üí business logic)

### **Key Architecture Decisions**:
- **Unified Architecture**: Single voice, single search, single NLP processor
- **Zero Duplication**: Remove 10+ duplicate voice components across business pages
- **Clean Separation**: Universal infrastructure vs pure business logic components  
- **Simple Configuration**: Global vs component-specific behavior (single source of truth)
- **Preserved Functionality**: Search typing behavior completely unchanged
