# ElevateBusiness 360Â° - TODO

### **STEP 1: CHECK STATUS OF ALL BELOW ITEMS AND LET ME KNOW YOUR VIEW**

1. WO Status history is not there but we should maintain that
2. WO can't have material shortage as WO can't be created from SO until n unless all material is available for SO
3. We should show matrerial allocated details in all WO for even complete ones 
4. We need to figure out if we need to show header and search bar while scrolling so that we get bigger space for showing all cards
5.  We should also show visual for allocating material, creating WO, allocating machine, allocating worker when we say start production.
6. I feel WO is showing material expanded section, audit trail details which may not be valuable on everytime user is trying to update. see everythign has different value at different time, initially material details are good, but once WO is started then update is the most important thing and not consumption or status history. 
7. We should show somewhere which SO, WO is related to in Header for just faster scann
8.
