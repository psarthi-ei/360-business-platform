    "content": "💔 365 Days of Stories – Day 55: To Every Senior Developer Worried About Job Safety in the Age of AI\n\nIn the last 18 months, I’ve spoken to many of my friends—senior developers and architects in their 40s and 50s.\n\nAnd I’ve seen the pain in their eyes when they say:\n💬 “The company thinks I’m too old.”\n💬 “Technology has moved on without me.”\n💬 “Why hire me when a younger developer with AI can do the same work cheaper?”\n\nIt hurts. These are people who built systems, led teams, solved problems no tool could.\nAnd now, they are made to feel irrelevant.\n\nHonestly? I used to believe it too.\n\nI thought AI had leveled the field—so much that experience no longer mattered.\nThat if a tool can generate code, a junior with AI could replace a senior.\n\nUntil I experienced it myself.\n\n🚀 My Journey with AI\n\nLast month, while building my product MVP, I leaned heavily on AI.\n\n✅ Requirements? Documented with ChatGPT.\n✅ Tech stack? Finalized.\n✅ Next step? UI/UX design.\n\nI assumed AI would do the heavy lifting.\nBut reality struck—no tool created production-ready UI/UX.\n\nThat’s when I discovered Claude Code.\n\n🤯 Claude Felt Like a Whole Team\n\nClaude wasn’t just writing snippets. It felt like an entire development team in a box:\n🎨 UI/UX Designer\n💻 Frontend Developer\n⚙️ Backend Developer\n🧪 Tester\n🚀 DevOps Engineer\n\nIt brainstormed, generated codebases, debugged, deployed—everything.\n\nAnd for a moment, I felt uneasy.\n👉 If Claude can do all this, what’s left for me?\n\n⚡ The Breakthrough\n\nSo I asked Claude: “Can you replace developers?”\n\nIts reply stopped me:\n💬 “I can generate code, but I can’t decide the architecture.”\n💬 “I can deploy, but you must tell me where.”\n💬 “I’m like a junior developer. I need direction.”\n\nThat’s when it clicked.\n\nAI isn’t here to replace senior developers.\nAI is here to make them unstoppable.\n\n🏗️ The New Reality\n\nCompanies may not need armies of juniors anymore.\nBut they need senior developers and architects more than ever—people who can:\n🧭 Make architectural decisions\n🛡️ Validate AI’s output\n📐 Balance trade-offs\n💡 Provide context & direction\n\nWith AI as your ally, you’re no longer just a developer.\nYou’re a force multiplier.\nOne senior with AI can achieve what once required a full team.\n\n❤️ My Takeaway\n\nIf you’re a senior developer worried about your future, hear me out:\n\n❌ You’re not obsolete.\n✅ You’re needed more than ever—if you embrace AI.\n\nYour experience is the compass.\nAI is the engine.\n\nTogether, you can build faster, smarter, and better than ever before.\n\nThe future doesn’t belong to those who fear AI.\nIt belongs to those who treat AI as their junior developer—and lead it with wisdom.",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 54: I couldn’t even get someone to talk to me. That was the real pain.\n\nWhen I started ElevateIdea two years back, we explored multiple business ideas.\n\nSome were products. Some were services.\nAll of them died for the same reason:\n\nI couldn’t reach the customer.\nNot to pitch. Not to sell.\nJust to ask:\n👉 “Do you even need something like this?”\n\nAnd I didn’t know how to even begin that conversation.\n\nI come from a tech background.\nI wasn’t a natural at outreach.\nI didn’t know where to find people, what to write, or how to get a response.\n\nSo I started experimenting.\n\nFirst, I discovered LinkedIn Sales Navigator.\nFinally, I could filter by stage, title, geography — and identify my ICP: early-stage startup founders.\n\nThat felt like a breakthrough.\n\nI sent connection requests with personalized messages.\nPeople accepted.\n\nBut after that?\nSilence.\nNo replies. No conversations.\n\nI started reacting to posts, nudging again, trying to stay visible.\nBut personalizing every first message was burning me out.\nHours of effort — with nothing to show for it.\n\nThen a founder friend said:\n\n“You need to call people.”\n\nHe introduced me to Lusha, where I could find phone numbers and emails.\n\nI tried calling.\n\nMost people hung up.\nSome stayed on just because I said I was the founder.\n\nIt felt awful.\nI told my friend, “This isn’t working.”\n\nHe said:\n\n“If you want to be a cricketer, you’ve got to face 1000 balls.”\n\nIt made sense. But I still didn’t know where to play.\n\nThen came Apollo — and finally, some rhythm.\nI built a basic but repeatable outreach flow — the one I still use:\n\nSend cold email to my ICP\n→ Not personalized. Just direct and credibility-focused\n\nFollow-up email after 2 days\n→ Just 2 lines\n\nLinkedIn connection request after 3 more days\n→ Again, direct. No fluff\n\nPersonalized message only if they respond\n\nIf someone takes the effort to reply, even a “Hi” — I do my research and respond personally.\n\nBecause if they made time for me, I owe them that much.\n\nSlowly, it started working.\n📬 Email open rate: 62.2%\n🔗 Click rate: 6.9%\n📥 Reply / Connection acceptance: 18.8%\n🤝 Interested in intro call: 4.3%\n\nAll meetings are 45-minute Google Meet intros.\nI ask for consent to record, and I share the recording afterward.\nThat small gesture helps me stay in their mind.\n\nAnd the best part?\nPeople now ask me how I do outbound.\nFounders. Marketers. Even early sales teams.\n\nI still don’t think I’ve “figured it out.”\nBut I’ve gone from stuck and silent → to structured conversations with intent.\n\nA mentor told me recently:\n“If a founder can’t sell, they can’t build a real business.”\n\nI feel that now. Deeply.\n\nSales isn’t about tricks.\nIt’s about learning how to earn someone’s time, when they owe you nothing.\n\nStill learning. Still growing.\n\nBut I wanted to share this journey — raw and real.\n\nIf you're figuring it out too, happy to swap notes.\n\nhashtag#FounderJourney hashtag#OutboundSales hashtag#StartupStruggles hashtag#ZeroToOne hashtag#DemandGen hashtag#RealTalk",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 53: The Invisible Math of Entrepreneurship\n\nFor the last two years, I’ve been trying to build a business.\n\nI started with a vision — to offer top-quality tech services, like ThoughtWorks. But it didn’t take long to realize: we’re not ThoughtWorks. Not yet. That credibility is earned, not assumed.\n\nSo I navigated. Pivoted. Adapted. Tried a different customer segment. Then another. Then another. Across domains, across business models — constantly moving, constantly learning.\n\nAnd throughout this journey, one question keeps coming up.\n\nFrom family, friends, well-wishers, even strangers:\n“How long will you keep doing this?”\n\nIt’s a fair question.\nBecause from the outside, it looks like I’m drifting.\nBecause there are no big wins to show.\nBecause I’m not making much money right now.\n\nBut here’s what I told my sister recently:\n\nLet’s look at life as a balance sheet — not of profit and loss, but of happiness and fulfillment.\n\nIn the last 10 years, working in corporate, I made money. A good amount.\nBut was I happy?\nHonestly, no.\nI had more moments of internal restlessness than joy.\n\nIn the last two years, I’ve made almost no money.\nBut am I happy?\n\nSurprisingly, yes.\n\nDespite the emotional lows, the unknowns, the self-doubt…\nI’ve had more fulfilling moments — moments of clarity, excitement, and creative joy — than I had in the previous decade.\n\nBecause every day I get to think freely.\nEvery day a new idea visits me.\nEvery day, I get to explore it — no approvals, no bureaucracy, no “deck reviews.”\nJust me and the raw possibility of creation.\n\nIn a job, even if you have a great idea, it needs to pass through ten filters. And most ideas die quietly.\nBut in entrepreneurship, you get to test your idea fast. You pitch. You chase. You fail or succeed quickly.\nYou learn fast. You move fast. You evolve fast.\n\nAnd that freedom, that speed, that space to explore — it’s priceless.\n\nYesterday, I met a businessman doing over ₹100 crores in revenue.\nAnd I shared this feeling:\n“Entrepreneurship is a lonely journey. There’s no formal education for it. No standard playbook. You just figure it out in the trenches.”\n\nHe smiled and said,\n“You’re right. I’m still figuring it out too. The struggle never ends. But if you keep showing up, something will eventually click.”\n\nThat stayed with me.\n\nSo yes, I’m still trying.\nAnd maybe tomorrow I’ll pivot again.\nMaybe I’ll fail again.\nBut I know one thing for sure:\nI’m finally living a life with no boundaries.\n\nAnd for me, that’s already a win.",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 52: Moonlighting — Survival or Betrayal?\n\nI had an intense conversation today with a very senior professional. We were talking about the rising trend of moonlighting, and more importantly, why it's no longer just a choice — it’s becoming a necessity.\n\nThink about it.\n\nWe’re living in a time where employment is no longer guaranteed. Especially in IT and private sectors, even senior professionals are being told during appraisals:\n\n“You should be thankful you even have a job.”\n\nLayoffs are becoming routine — across the US and increasingly in India.\nAnd it’s not about performance. It’s about markets, cost cuts, AI disruptions, or simply… “restructuring.”\n\nNow, let’s flip this.\n\nIf employers are under no obligation to ensure long-term employment,\nthen why are employees expected to remain single-loyal, dependent, and obedient?\n\nShouldn't we, as professionals, create backup plans, build side gigs, learn new skills, or even take up second projects (ethically, of course)?\n\nWhy is it considered betrayal to safeguard your own livelihood?\n\nI’m not promoting conflict of interest or dishonesty.\nIf you’re hired to work 9 to 5 — give your best. Deliver. Be professional.\nBut what you do from 6 to 11, or over weekends, is your time.\n\nI think moonlighting is no longer a fringe practice. It’s becoming a quiet revolution.\n\nAs a mentor, we should be encouraging people to take up multiple roles, build side income, or grow personal brands.\n\nThis isn’t greed. This is survival.\nIt’s planning ahead in a world that gives no second chances.\n\nWe need to stop vilifying moonlighting and start having an honest conversation:\n\nIn a world with zero job security, do employees not have the right to secure their own future?\n\nAnd yes, companies can — and should — define guardrails like no conflict of interest, data confidentiality, etc. But a blanket ban on working outside your job? That’s outdated thinking.\n\nWould love to hear your take —\nAre you for moonlighting? Against it? Or somewhere in between?\n\nLet’s talk.",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 51: No One Led. Everyone Owned.\n\nAbout 20 days ago, my wife returned from her hometown with a question:\n\n“Why don’t we celebrate Jagannath Rath Yatra in our society? We celebrate everything else—Durga Puja, Ganesh Chaturthi, Onam… but not Jagannath Rath Yatra, which is so deeply rooted in Odisha and is one of the four dhams of India.”\n\nI casually said, “If you can pull that off in one week, that would be outstanding.”\nI didn’t think much of it. But she meant every word.\n\nWhat followed was a masterclass—not just in event organization—but in leadership, collaboration, and execution.\n\nShe started with nothing. No team. No plan.\nShe just began calling every Odia family in the society. Eventually, 7–9 people came forward to support the idea.\n\nThat very evening, the first meeting happened.\nFrom Day 2 onward, not everyone showed up consistently. But someone always did. The work began.\n\nOne by one, problems came—and were solved:\n\nPermission from the association? Taken.\n\nApproval from senior citizens for using the temple area? Negotiated and resolved.\n\nWhere do we get a Rath (chariot) on rent? After much searching and calling, they found a temple willing to help.\n\nWho will be the Pandit? Sorted.\n\nHow to create a spiritual vibe? She approached the Hare Krishna group who sang every weekend nearby. They said yes to perform on the Rath Yatra day.\n\nDecoration, coordination, rituals, logistics — solved, together.\n\nIn just 10–15 days, what seemed almost laughably impossible, actually happened.\n\nBut here’s the most remarkable part.\n\nEvery time I asked her, “Who’s leading all this? Are you driving everything?”\nShe smiled and said,\n\n“I’m only doing what I can. Others are doing their part. No one’s leading. Everyone is owning.”\n\nThere was no formal leader. No hierarchy.\nNo one delegated tasks. No one chased follow-ups.\nEveryone simply took responsibility for what they could do—and followed through.\n\nNo egos. No blame games. Just joint ownership.\n\nAnd it made me wonder—\n\nIn the corporate world, we obsess over “who’s leading the team.”\nWe define a leader. Give them the title. Hold them accountable for delivery.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe—the best teams don’t need a leader to follow. They only need a mission to own.\n\nThat day, I saw leadership in its purest form—distributed, quiet, shared.\n\nMy wife didn’t call herself a leader.\nBut to me, she led by letting others lead.\n\nAnd I think that’s the future of leadership—not managing people, but enabling ownership.\n\nThe best leadership is invisible. The best teams don’t follow one person—they follow one purpose.",

Can you help us arrange a Rath for a Jagannath Yatra?”\n“That we don’t do.”\n\nI tried to persuade him:\nWe live in a 1,500+ unit apartment in Electronic City — a massive crowd, perfect visibility.\nI even said, “You can brand the Rath. This will give your startup great marketing”\n\nHe replied,\n“We are already doing marketing, sir. Thank you.

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 50 — This Isn’t Just a Building. It’s Our Grandparents’ House\n\nWe have a piece of ancestral land in Patna — in the heart of the city.\nNot just a plot. It carries stories. Emotion. Legacy.\n\nWe live in Bangalore now, but after years of thinking, we decided to build a house on that land. Not an apartment complex. Not flats for rent.\nA house.\n\nA home where we visit with joy.\nWhere my kids can say, “This is our grandparents’ house.”\nWhere memories can be made — not just investments.\n\nBut in Patna, that’s an odd dream.\nThe default mindset is: If you’ve got land, maximize it. Build four floors, rent out three, stay in one. It’s a math equation — ROI over emotion.\n\nStill, I stuck to my conviction and started my search for an architect.\nAnd I found one — very senior, very established. NIT graduate. Practicing for 30+ years. A well-known name in the city.\nWe got talking, created a rough plan. But something didn’t sit right. He wasn’t getting me. My vision.\n\nThen came another senior guy. Even more seasoned. Looked at the plan and said, “It’s fine. You shouldn’t change anything.”\nAgain, I felt unheard.\n\nThen, a friend referred a young architect. Not very “established.”\nDidn’t have a fancy office — just a makeshift space on the ground floor of an apartment.\nNot from a top college. Not even known for designing residential homes.\n\nI went in with low expectations.\n\nBut I walked out sold.\n\nHe listened.\nHe understood why this home mattered.\nHe said something I’ll never forget:\n\n“You want a house, not a set of flats. You have land — use it for what you feel, not what the market tells you.”\nHe suggested a garden. Thoughtfully planned space.\nHe brought in landscaping — a word most builders in Patna would laugh at.\n\nIt wasn’t about how many buildings he had designed.\nIt was about the alignment.\n\nThat day I decided: I’m going ahead with him.\nNot because of degrees. Not because of reputation.\nBecause he cared and had the hunger to make something meaningful.\n\nAnd that brings me to a broader point — about hiring, teams, startups, and life.\n\nWe often chase people with the “right” tick marks:\nFancy colleges. Big company logos. Decades of experience.\n\nBut sometimes, the best fit comes from those who aren’t yet famous.\nThey’re raw, real, and ready to prove themselves.\nThey listen deeply. Build passionately. Care genuinely.\n\nI learned this while trying to build a house.\nBut it’s just as true in the boardroom.\n\nDon’t just hire resumes.\nHire hunger.",

    "content": "💭 365 Days of Stories – Day 48 - Are We Chasing Fulfillment or Just Fulfilling Responsibilities? \n\nWhen I look back after 20+ years in the corporate world, a strange realization hits me:\n\n👉 We were never really taught to chase fulfillment.\nWe were taught to chase a job.\n\n👨‍👩‍👦 “If you study well, you’ll get a good job.”\nThat was the golden mantra passed down from our parents.\n\nEspecially in the '90s, if you didn’t crack engineering or medicine, you were told:\n❌ “Your life will be miserable.”\n\nI wasn’t a great student.\nDidn’t know why I was studying—just that I had to.\n\n📚 I landed in a private college.\nNot because I was passionate about civil engineering, but because I had limited options.\n\nThen reality hit.\nThere were no jobs.\n\nThat’s when I finally understood what “study well” was supposed to mean.\n\n💻 Luckily, I discovered computers. And that changed everything.\n\n💡 I loved coding. I found joy in it.\nBut even then, the goal wasn’t joy. It was still:\n“How do I get a job?”\n\nSo I pursued a course at NCST.\nIt was tough, but I had one clear motivation:\n👉 “If I clear this, I’ll get a job.”\n\nAnd it worked.\nI got into software. Life slowly started improving.\n\n💼 In the early years?\nYou’re chasing needs.\nYour salary is always less than what life demands.\n\nMid-career?\nYou earn more.\nYou buy the house. The car. You travel abroad.\n✅ Tick. ✅ Tick. ✅ Tick.\n\nAnd then… something shifts.\n\nYou pause and ask:\n🔍 “Now what?”\n\nI was growing in my career too—\nWorked with seasoned leaders.\nHeld senior roles.\n\nBut even those stopped feeling exciting.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the drive had changed.\n☸️ From survival → success → significance.\n⚛️ From chasing salary → to chasing meaning.\n\nSo I took bold calls.\nQuit safe jobs.\nStarted up. Failed. Tried again.\n\nNow, I’m in my second startup.\nStill struggling. Still figuring it out.\nBut at least… I feel alive.\n\n🌱 Here’s what I see around me—and why I’m sharing this:\n\nMost people I talk to—especially in their early to mid-40s—feel stuck.\n\nWhen I ask, “What next?”\nThe response is usually:\n\n💬 “Another 10-15 years to go. Let’s make some money. Focus on kids. Our time is done.”\n💬 “If I was meant to be a CEO or do something big, it would’ve happened by now.”\n💬 “Now it’s just about managing the rest of the journey.”\n\nSo… that’s it?\n\nIs this the life we were meant to live?\n\nJust fulfilling responsibilities—paying EMIs, saving for college, waiting for retirement?\n\nWhere is the joy?\nWhere is the fulfillment?\n\nAnd more importantly…\n\n📌 Do we realize that living unhappily slowly eats away at our life?\n\nWhile living happily—feeling energized and alive—might just extend it?\n\nWe say we want to give the best to our kids.\nBut one of the greatest gifts we can give them is:\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 A happy, healthy parent who stays around longer.\nNot just money.\n\n💡 I’m not here to preach.\nI don’t have all the answers.\nI’m still figuring it out—every day.\n\nBut I’ve started asking questions.\n\nAnd maybe… that’s where change begins.\n\n👣 Are you?",

    "content": "💭 365 Days of Story: Day 47 — Are You a Job Person or a Business Person?\n\nThere’s an easier way to figure out if you’re made for business or for a job.\nNot by looking forward — but by looking back.\n\nI’m in my mid-40s now. And when I look at my 20+ year career, the signs were always there — I had just never looked at them so thoughtfully before.\n\nHere are a few powerful traits that helped me reflect:\n\n1️⃣ Do you always say yes to your boss?\n🙅‍♂️ If your answer is no — dig deeper.\n💬 Do you challenge decisions?

I wasn’t learning.\nI didn’t feel excited about what I was building.\nSo I stepped away to try and build something of my own. 🚶‍♂️💡\n\nAnd that’s when the real challenge began.\n\nNot just building. But explaining. 💬\n\n📍 Explaining why you left job\n📍 Explaining what you’re doing now\n📍 Explaining how your business is doing\n📍 Explaining your changing plans \n📍 Explaining what’s next \n\nAnd the truth is — most people around you genuinely care.\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Your parents. 💑 Your spouse. 🙍‍♀️🙎🏻‍♂️Your Brother and Sisters 🤝 Your close friends.\nThey’re not trying to pull you down.\nThey’re just... worried. 😟\n\nThey see you tired, uncertain, earning nothing 💸 — and their instinct is to protect you.\n🗣️ “Maybe it’s time to go back to a job.”\n🗣️ “You’ve tried enough.”\n🗣️ “Why struggle when you’re so capable?”\n\nAnd then there are others —\n🤔 well-meaning colleagues, 👥 distant friends, 🧑‍💻 old acquaintances.\nThey ask: “What exactly are you doing these days?”\n\nSome are curious.\nSome are skeptical.\nBut beneath it all, everyone’s quietly trying to figure out:\nCan you really make it? 🎯\n\nIt’s not malicious. But it’s heavy.\nBecause you start to feel alone. 😔\n\nLike you’re the only one who chose the harder path,\nand now you have to prove — to everyone — that it wasn’t a mistake. ⚖️\n\nSee, in a job, when you struggle, people say:\n✅ “Don’t worry, it’ll get better.”\nBut in business, when you struggle, the message — spoken or unspoken — is often:\n❌ “Maybe it’s time to stop.”\n\nThat’s the part no one tells you about:\n\n😶 The loneliness.\n🤯 The second-guessing.\n🕵️ The feeling that you’re being quietly measured, every day.\n\nBut if there’s one thing I’ve learned over the last two years, it’s this:\n\nThe only way to figure it out… is to stay. 🛡️\n\nNo matter how hard it gets.\nNo matter how slow the wins come.\nNo matter how many times you think of going back. 🔁\n\nBecause this journey — as lonely as it feels — is also yours.\nAnd staying in the game, even when it’s painful, is the only real shot you’ve got at building something that truly matters. 🧱🚀\n\n💬 Have you felt this pressure from people around you while doing something unconventional?

    "content": "🚨 365 Days of Stories: Day 45 — The Weight of Titles\n\nIn today’s job market, heavy job titles feel heavier than ever.\n\nAt small companies, everyone is Director, VP, or Head of Something — but often, the experience doesn’t match the title.\n\nMeanwhile, senior leaders from large companies with real experience struggle to get shortlisted for interviews.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs experience no longer valued? \nWere their skills only relevant inside their old company? \nOr is AI, cost pressure, reshaping the market?\n\nI don’t have all answers, but here’s what my journey taught me.\n\n🔹 2012 — IBM.\nMy first fancy title: Business Development Leader for IBM Worklight India.\n\nIBM had just acquired Worklight for $70M. Many tech services company wanted to partner with us. Mobile was hot, and I was in the middle.\n\nAt a big event in Singapore, people exchanged cards with me like I was the next big thing. I believed I was calling the shots.\n\nIt was my first sales role.\n\nComing from a tech background, leadership thought a techie selling would do better than traditional sales. It was an experiment — I was the subject.\n\nAfter a year with no big revenue, I was asked to move on.\n\nIt stung.\n\nAfter being a top individual contributor, I thought I was a natural at sales — at least in my mind.\n\nThis was my first major career setback. I learned belief without results doesn’t matter.\n\n🔹 Next: Delivery Project Executive for one of IBM’s top global accounts.\n\nI managed ~140 people across cities.\n\nHere’s the truth: I never climbed the traditional ladder. No first-line or senior manager first — I jumped straight into a senior role.\n\nSometimes, being an insider helps land roles at any level. Most leadership roles need common sense, confidence, and connection—not rocket science.\n\n⏳ The role wasn’t easy.\n\nToo many leaders from India and US managed the account. I struggled for almost a year to find where I could make an impact.\n\nI asked tough questions about accountability.\n\nDue to cost pressures, a reorg forced a decision: either India or US would lead — not both. \n\nI had to move out of the role, and that’s when the next role came up.\n\n🔹 The next role? Leading a small team of 10-15 people.\n\nIt felt like a demotion.\n\nI escalated it internally and heard: “Don’t look at team size, look at impact.”\n\nBack then, it felt like an excuse.\n\nFrustrated and craving meaning, I left IBM.\n\nI spent months trying to earn independently.\n\nThen came the biggest realization:\n\nWithout a company, titles mean nothing.\n\nYou can’t earn if your value doesn’t translate outside a system.\n\nI stopped valuing fancy titles, team size, or reports.\n\nWhat matters is:\n\n🔸 What value do I bring?\n🔸 What impact can I create — with or without a title?\n\nSince then, I’ve carried many heavy titles but don’t take pride in them.\n\n⚛️ Titles don’t define you. Impact does.\n\nStop chasing meaningless metrics like team size or designation.\n\n☸️ What matters is: Can you move the needle? Create value? Solve real problems?",

    "content": "🚨 365 Days of Stories: Day 44 – The Quiet Struggle of Job Hunting in Tech Leadership\n\nOver the past two years, I’ve stepped into the job market a few times.\n\nEach time, I gave it 2–3 weeks.\nAnd each time, I stepped back — not because I wasn’t good enough…\nBut because I realised the process wasn’t built for someone like me.\n\nLet me explain.\n\n🧭 I left my last role in tech leadership with no plans of going back.\nI wanted to build. To create. To chase something meaningful in life.\n\nAnd I did.\nI started ElevateIdea and poured myself into it.\n\nBut like any entrepreneurial journey, there were highs and lows.\nDuring the tougher patches, I’d ask:\n\n“Is there something meaningful I can be part of —\nWhere I can help take a business from 1 to 10?”\n\nBecause maybe 0 to 1 wasn’t working for me right then.\n\nSo I’d test the job market — hoping for a great opportunity.\n\nBut what I found was a system that didn’t know what to do with people like me.\n\n🛠️ Let’s be honest — job hunting for senior roles is a different game.\n\nThere are only three common paths:\n\n🔹 Apply online — and see 1000+ applicants within a day.\nMost leadership roles get filled internally or through referrals.\nThe posting? Often just a formality.\n\n🔹 Reach out to your network — and hear the same thing:\n“Hiring freeze.”\n“Only niche AI/data/cloud roles are open.”\n\n🔹 Wait for consultants — who rarely call for real leadership roles.\nIt’s usually mid-level manager roles in smaller firms.\n\n🧪 I even tried a more direct approach.\n\nIt’s easy to guess the hiring manager in smaller to mid-sized companies.\nIf a VP role is open, it likely reports to the CTO/CEO.\n\nSo I reached out — direct, thoughtful messages.\nBut mostly, I got polite replies like:\n\n“Please apply on our careers page.”\n\nNo dialogue.\nNo curiosity.\nNo interest in what someone experienced might bring.\n\n⚠️ That’s when I paused and asked:\n\n“If I’m doing all this and still not converting — is this about me, or the system?”\n\nHere’s what I’ve realised:\n\n1️⃣ Tech isn’t growing like it used to.\nIt’s been 3–4 years of stagnation. Companies are cautious, not ambitious.\n\n2️⃣ AI has shifted the game.\nWork once done by teams is now handled by tools.\nHiring managers want specialists — not broad leaders.\n\n3️⃣ Leadership roles rarely go public.\nThey’re filled via internal moves or warm intros.\n\nSo yes, I’ve paused my job search every time.\nNot because I gave up —\nBut because I got frustrated with the experience.\n\nEndless hunting.\nNo responses.\n\nIt’s nearly impossible to find something meaningful in this crowded market.\nNot when most roles are either closed or transactional.\n\nI wasn’t chasing a title.\nI was looking for impact.\n\nAnd when I couldn’t find it?\n\nI’d go back to ElevateIdea —\nBack to building the kind of work I was searching for all along.\n\n💬 If you’re a senior leader navigating the same confusion — know that you’re not alone. This isn’t a failure. It’s a moment of reflection in a changing world.\n\nLet’s connect.👇\n\nhashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Leadership",

    "content": "🚨 365 Days of Stories: Day 43 – Sales Is Hard. Really Hard.\n\nWhen I started my technology consulting and services business, I was stuck on a basic but brutal question:\n\nHow do I reach the right people to pitch what I’m building?\n\nEveryone had advice:\n\n🗣️ “Go to meetups.”\n👥 “Leverage your network.”\n🎤 “Attend startup events.”\n\nThe idea was simple: sales happen when you meet people.\n\nSo I gave it a shot.\n\n📍 I went to a startup meetup in Koramangala.\n\nVCs were on stage.\nAround 50 attendees — mostly in their early 20s.\n\nAnd me? I felt completely out of place.\n\n💭 The questions were too basic. The vibe felt off.\nGreat for someone starting their journey — not for someone in the middle of it.\n\nTo make it worse, someone even tried to sell me a current account.\n\nI walked away frustrated. That was my first and last meetup.\n\n🧠 So I went back to the drawing board.\n\nI asked myself — who exactly am I trying to sell to?\n\nI built my Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):\n\n🎯 Founders & CEOs of mid-scale tech-driven companies (FinTech, HealthTech, AgriTech)\n🏢 Company size: 200–1000 employees\n👨‍💻 Engineering team: less than 100 people\n\nWhy them?\n\n🔹 Tech is core to their business\n🔹 But their engineering team is usually small\n🔹 Their product works — but may struggle to scale or compete\n🔹 And they value outside tech expertise because that’s not their strength\n\n❓ Next question: Where do these people hang out?\n\nDefinitely not at meetups.\nAnd even at large events, they’re on stage — not in the crowd.\n\n🎪 Good events happen once a quarter in a city.\nAnd even then, Founders & CEOs come to speak or meet investors — not take sales calls.\n\n⏳ Time was money. I couldn't afford to wait 2–3 months for a shot.\n\n💡 So I turned to LinkedIn.\n\nEvery founder and CEO is on LinkedIn.\nAnd I could reach out — without waiting for an event invite.\n\nI started sending personalised connection requests every day.\n\n📬 3 months → 500+ connection requests\n✅ 166 accepted (30% success rate)\n\nBut that was just the start.\n\n📌 I followed up with every lead 4–5 times\n📆 Over 6–8 weeks\n📩 Across LinkedIn + email\n📊 Every message tracked\n\n😓 But the results?\n\nOut of 150+ promising leads…\n👉 Only 2 actual conversations.\n\nIt was painful.\n\n⚠️ And that’s when I had to ask myself:\n\n“If I’m doing all this and still not converting — am I solving a real problem?”\n\nHere’s what I realised:\n\n🔸 I was pitching tech consulting — something everyone offers\n🔸 My messaging wasn’t cutting through the noise\n🔸 And more importantly — my offer didn’t feel urgent or essential\n\nTo a busy founder, I probably looked like just another service provider in a crowded inbox.\n\nThey weren’t ignoring me.\nThey were ignoring one more generic pitch.\n\n🔥 Lesson: Sales is hard — especially when your offer doesn’t sound urgent or unique.\nYou may be solving a real problem — but if the positioning is off, no one pays attention.\n\n🎯 You only get a few seconds in someone’s inbox. Make them count.\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Sales\n",

    "content": "🚨 365 Days of Stories: Day 42 - You Might Be Solving the Right Problem — But Selling It the Wrong Way\n\nA few months into building my tech consulting business, I had hit a wall.\n\nNo leads. No conversions. Just silence.\n\nSo, I reached out to a seasoned entrepreneur I respected and asked him bluntly,\n“What am I doing wrong?”\n\nHe didn’t sugarcoat it.\n\n“You’re in a crowded space. Everyone’s selling tech services.\nWhy you? What’s your edge? What gives you the right to win?”\n\nI paused for a moment — then replied:\n\n“I’ve built large-scale products.\nI’ve rescued tech projects that were on fire.\nThat’s what I know best.”\n\nHe smiled and said something that changed everything:\n\n“Then that’s what you should sell.\nNot generic services. Sell your superpower.”\n\n💡That day, I repositioned everything.\n\nI ditched the laundry list of tech services and built a focused offering:\n\n1. Tech Turnaround – rescuing struggling projects\n2. Tech Transformation – helping scale or modernize existing ones\n\nAnd I got crystal clear on who I wanted to serve:\n\n👉 Mid-scale tech-driven businesses — companies like FinTech, HealthTech, AgriTech with less than 1000 employees.\n\nWhy them?\n\nBecause in these businesses:\n\n1. Tech is essential but not their core skill.\n2. The tech team is usually just 5–10% of the org.\n3. Products are built to run the business, not always to scale or compete.\n4. And most importantly — they value outside expertise.\n\nWith a sharper pitch and a clear customer profile, I began reaching out to founders.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I finally landed a meeting with a mid-sized FinTech CEO.\n\nI walked in thinking I’d sell.\nInstead, I listened. Asked questions. Shared my hypothesis.\n\nAnd then he said something that hit me like a brick:\n\n“So you’re like a pest control guy for tech?”\n“You clean out the cockroaches… or redesign the kitchen if needed.”\n\nI laughed. “Exactly.”\n\nBut then he gave me the real insight:\n\n“Look — most of us know our kitchen is messy.\nBut as long as the restaurant’s full and customers are happy…\nwe don’t care.”\n\n“Even if we want to fix it, we hesitate.\nBringing in an outsider feels risky — like exposing our flaws.\nWhat if they brag about it later? What if they don’t get it?”\n\n“We’re not just running a company — we’re protecting our reputation.”\n\nThat conversation flipped a switch in my head.\n\n🔥 I wasn’t solving the wrong problem.\nI was just selling it the wrong way.\n\nNo founder wants to feel like their house is on fire.\nBut every founder wants to scale, strengthen, or future-proof their product.\n\nI didn’t need to change the solution.\nI needed to change the story.\n\n🧠 Lesson: A good solution with the wrong story doesn’t sell.\nFrame your offering in the context of where your customer wants to go — not where they’re failing today.\n\nHave you ever changed your pitch — and suddenly, everything clicked?\n\nDrop your story below 👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#TechConsulting hashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#FounderInsights hashtag#ProductStrategy hashtag#PositioningMatters hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#TechLeadership",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 56: I Didn’t Write Code — But I Built More (with Claude Code)\n\nI’m a founder and seasoned tech leader. I haven’t written production code in 4–5 years—yet my MVP is moving fast.\n\nWhy? I’m building with Claude Code. I don’t type code; I tell what needs to exist. The machine drafts it. My job isn’t to do the thing—it’s to say the thing precisely and make the right decisions.\n\n⸻\n\n🧭 How I build now\n\n📝 Start with plain-English requirements: who it’s for, what “done” feels like, what must never break.\n🧠 Ask for options & trade-offs: speed vs reliability, cost vs resilience, now vs later.\n🏗️ Tighten architecture: clear boundaries, contracts, failure paths.\n🧪 Enforce standards: tests, logs, naming, alerts—so correctness becomes boring.\n🤝 Decide → constrain → verify: Claude Code writes; I think, articulate, verify.\n\n⸻\n\n🎯 What matters (more than ever)\n\n🔎 Deep requirement understanding\n🗣️ Crisp articulation so AI (and humans) build the right thing\n📐 Architectural thinking with conscious trade-offs\n📊 Observability & testing (prove it works on bad days, not just demo days)\n\nWhat fades: 🧰 tool worship, ⚙️ framework trivia, 📚 memorizing APIs.\n\n⸻\n\n🔄 The big shift in “great developer”\n\nFor years, “great” meant acing DSA and patterns. Still useful—but no longer the definition.\n\nToday, greatness =\n👂 Grasp the business & name real constraints\n🧩 Shape systems that fit outcomes and realities\n🧾 Write acceptance criteria so clear the build becomes obvious\n🛡️ Design for failure and real-world messiness\n🧵 Tell the story (why this, why now, why not that)\n\nYou can be brilliant at algorithms and still be a poor builder if you can’t explain intent.\nConversely, if you frame outcomes and reason about trade-offs, you can ship great software—without typing every line.\n\n⸻\n\n✡️ How I review work (in the AI era)\n\n❌ “Did we pick the coolest library?”\n✅ “Is this the right shape for the problem—and will it hold up on a bad day?”\n❌ Line-by-line obsession\n✅ Review intent & invariants: contracts, failure paths, tests, observability\n\n⸻\n\n✍️ Coding today is telling, not typing\n\nThe computer does the keystrokes. We own clarity, decisions, and proof.\n\nI’ll keep sharing notes as I build this MVP with Claude Code. I’m enjoying the shift—and if you love clear thinking more than clever syntax, you probably will too.\n\nIf you didn’t have to type the code, what would you get crystal-clear about first?\n\n⸻\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#AI hashtag#ClaudeCode hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#Architecture\nhashtag#Product hashtag#MVP",

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 41 - 🧠 Lesson: Not Every Exciting Idea is a Scalable Business\n\nLet’s talk about another business idea I worked on for a couple of months during my second entrepreneurial stint — and what I learned from it.\n\nOne fine day, a close friend called me. His wife had recently started a fashion business on Instagram, and he said excitedly,\n“One of her reels just went viral — over 30 million views!”\nI was like, “Wow, that’s 3 crore people!”\n\nNaturally, I asked, “What are you guys selling?”\n\nHe said, “Memory quilts.”\nI paused. “What’s that?”\nHe explained — they collect old baby clothes from parents and stitch them into a quilt as a keepsake.\nIt was a beautiful, emotional product.\n\nThen I asked the obvious:\n“So what’s the problem if your reel has gone so viral?”\n\nHe said,\n\n“Between me, my wife, and one employee, we’re replying to 200 DMs every day, sitting 10–15 hours nonstop. But we get 1000+ comments daily — most of them are going unanswered. We’re probably losing real customers, and we can’t keep up.”\n“Can you automate this?” he asked.\n\nI wasn’t sure right away. But I said, “Give me a few days — I’ll explore.”\n\nI did a deep dive and discovered a tool called ManyChat that allows Instagram automation. I tested it on my own account and it worked like a charm.\n\nI built a full-blown automation that replied to every comment and DM, answered queries, qualified leads, collected customer info, and even took orders — all neatly tagged and tracked inside a CRM workflow.\n\nAll of this was set up in 2 weeks.\n\nThe results?\n\nTheir business grew 5X in a month.\nThey now spend just 1–2 hours a day handling actual buyers.\nThe rest of their time goes into improving the product and running the business.\n\nI was thrilled. I thought — this is a real opportunity!\nThere must be thousands of small businesses in India on Instagram — struggling with the same problem.\n\nSo I doubled down.\n\nI made a list of Instagram sellers with over 50K followers.\nFor one whole month, I reached out, pitched the automation, and waited for responses.\n\nBut… crickets.\n\nNo one signed up.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen I reflected, I realised:\nMy friend’s use case was an outlier.\nMost Instagram businesses don’t get 1000+ comments a day. Their reels don’t go viral regularly.\nThey simply didn’t need that level of automation.\n\nThe truth is —\n👉 Technology becomes critical only when the business reaches a scale where humans can’t keep up.\nAnd that moment doesn’t come for everyone.\n\nSo what looked like a high-potential idea… turned out to be a one-off case.\n\nAnd that’s the lesson.\n\n🔍 Lesson: Not Every Exciting Idea is a Scalable Business\n✅ Validate whether a problem exists for many — not just one successful use case\n❌ Don’t assume every virality is a repeatable model\n✅ Automation works — but only when the volume demands it\n❌ Don’t confuse exception with opportunity\n\nSometimes, ideas look huge… but they don’t scale.\n\nStill, it was worth exploring. Because you only learn by doing.",

    "content": "🚜 365 Days of Stories: Day 40 - If You’re Not Deeply Committed to the Problem, You’ll Quit Midway\n\nDuring my second entrepreneurial journey, my co-founder and I were talking about what kind of business we wanted to build.\n\n“It should be meaningful,” we agreed. “Purpose-driven. Impactful.”\n\nThat’s when he brought up an interesting issue:\n\n“Some days tomato prices are sky-high, other days farmers throw them on the road. It’s madness.”\n\nI asked — why?\n\nHe explained:\n\n“It’s all supply-demand mismatch. When too many farmers grow tomatoes, prices crash. When few do, prices skyrocket. And frustrated farmers dump their crop.”\n\nThat got us thinking.\n\nTomato demand is fairly constant — people consume it daily.\nSo why does supply fluctuate?\n\nThe answer: No visibility.\nFarmers make planting decisions based on guesswork.\nIf prices were good last season, everyone plants tomatoes.\nNext thing you know — oversupply, prices crash, losses.\n\nSo we asked — what if we could fix the supply side with better forecasting?\n\nWe thought we’d hit a jackpot.\n\nWe dug deeper and found that a few agritech companies were already solving this — connecting farmers with consistent buyers and forecasting demand.\n\nBut they barely scratched the surface — maybe 0.1% of India’s farmers.\n\nPlenty of room left. We were excited.\n\nWe even attended the Organic Millets trade fair in Bangalore, where hundreds of farmers had gathered.\n\nBut there, we hit a wall.\n\nWe realised we had zero domain knowledge.\nWe didn’t understand the context, the nuances, or even how to start building trust with farmers.\n\nMy co-founder, especially, felt strongly:\n\n“We can’t pursue this. It’s a long, hard road. And we’re not equipped.”\n\nAnd so, we dropped the idea.\n\nLooking back, I sometimes wonder if we gave up too soon.\n\nBut one thing is clear:\n\n👉🏽 If you’re not deeply committed to a problem, you won’t survive the journey.\n\n💥 Lesson: If You’re Not Deeply Committed to the Problem, You’ll Quit Midway\n✅ The problem should matter to you — deeply.\n❌ You can’t fake purpose or passion.\n✅ If the path is long (and it always is), only conviction will keep you going.\n\nHave you ever dropped a promising idea because it didn’t pull you in enough?\nWould love to hear your story. 👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Agritech hashtag#PurposeDriven hashtag#FounderJourney hashtag#Commitment hashtag#ImpactIdeas",

    "content": "🚦 365 Days of Stories: Day 39 - Don’t Just Pick a Big Problem — Pick the Right Problem\n\nLet’s talk about something that most first-time founders (including me) get wrong — how we pick a business idea.\n\n🧠 The Logic That Led Me In\nWhen I was starting my first venture, I asked the classic questions:\n\n\"Is this a real problem?\"\n\"Is it a large-scale problem?\"\n\nI looked around.\nWhat’s something everyone complains about?\nWhat hits us all every single day?\n\nTraffic.\n\nIt affects millions. It wastes hours. It causes stress.\nPerfect, right?\n\nI felt I had struck gold.\n\nThen came the “solution” — carpooling.\nSimple. Scalable. Socially impactful.\nI thought I had it all figured out.\n\nI mapped the usual pain points:\n\nCarpooling isn’t mainstream.\n\nPeople don’t trust strangers.\n\nCoordination is hard.\n\nAnd I believed — with tech, we can fix this.\n\nSo without further delay…\n\nI dove headfirst into building the product.\n\n🛠️ One Year Later… Reality Hits\nAfter months of design and coding marathons — the product was ready.\n\nIt was launched.\nAnd within weeks, I realised:\n\nI had spent a year solving a problem I didn’t fully understand.\n\nHere’s what went wrong:\n\n1️⃣ 🚧 Challenges I Hadn’t Anticipated\nChicken-and-Egg Problem\nWe needed both ride givers and takers, at the same time, in the same area.\nWithout both, the system didn’t work.\n\n2️⃣ Customer Acquisition = 💸💸💸\nGetting users on the platform wasn’t easy.\nIt needed capital, marketing muscle, and trust — none of which we had.\n\n3️⃣ Legal Grey Areas\nOn paper, carpooling seemed fine.\nEven my lawyer said there was no explicit restriction.\nBut on the ground? Cops stopping cars, questioning drivers.\nThe uncertainty scared users.\n\n4️⃣ “Social Good” Isn’t a Business Model\nEveryone says they care about pollution and traffic.\nBut very few change their habits for it.\nMass adoption needs personal incentive — not just a good cause.\n\n🎯 The Realisation\nIn hindsight, I should have done this instead:\n\n✔️ Built a dummy app or even a landing page\n✔️ Tested if people were interested\n✔️ Measured response, feedback, behaviour\n✔️ Asked: Will they actually use this? Would they pay for it?\n\nInstead, I went into product mode — because as technologists, that’s our comfort zone.\n\nBut startups aren’t built by writing code — they’re built by validating need.\n\nAnd this was the painful but powerful lesson I learned.\n\n🏆 Lesson #1: Don’t Just Pick a Big Problem — Pick the Right Problem\n✅ Make sure the problem is real for others, not just you\n✅ Validate the demand — even in the roughest form\n✅ Think about user behaviour, cost, scale, and legal reality\n❌ Don’t assume “if I build it, they will come”\n❌ Don’t fall in love with the idea before testing it\n\nThose 1.5 years taught me more than any book or MBA could.\nIt taught me humility, patience, and the brutal beauty of first principles thinking.\n\n👉 What’s one business idea you chased that didn’t work out?\nWhat did it teach you?\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#ProductMarketFit",

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 38 – The Best Cofounder Might Be the One Who Says No\n\nIn recent years, the IT industry has been going through a slowdown. With growing cost pressures, the first ones to be impacted are often the senior, highly paid professionals.\n\nThat’s how I came across a few friends—seasoned, highly capable folks—who suddenly found themselves out of a job.\n\nI saw this as an opportunity.\nMaybe one of them could be my next co-founder.\n\n💬 One conversation stood out.\nHe had great domain expertise (not in a space I was actively exploring, but still impressive).\nMore importantly, he was a great communicator—someone I thought could be a natural salesperson.\nThat was the complementary skill I was looking for.\n\nSo I pitched the idea of partnering up.\n\nHe appreciated it but said:\n\n“I’m currently looking for a job, so I can’t commit full-time. But I can help on a part-time basis.”\n\nI was clear:\n❌ No part-time founders.\n✅ Business is hard, and it needs full-time commitment from Day 1.\n\n⏳ Fast forward 5-6 months...\nHe still hadn't landed a job.\nThis time, he was open to exploring a full-time partnership.\n\nBut I didn’t want this to be a casual trial.\nSo I laid it out clearly—\n\n“Building a startup requires intense commitment. You need to be all in. For me, this is my second entrepreneurial journey, so I know what it takes—it’s an easy call. But for you, it’s the first time, so please think this through carefully.”\n\n“Also, talk to your wife. Without family support, you can’t last long in this journey.”\n\nHe appreciated the honesty.\nTook a few days.\nThen came back and said:\n\n“After thinking deeply… I don’t think I can commit to this journey. It’s too demanding, and I’m not ready for that level of effort. I’d rather wait for a job to come through.”\n\nI respected that answer.\nBecause he didn’t say yes just to escape unemployment.\nHe was self-aware enough to know what he wanted from life.\n\nAnd guess what?\nA year later, he did land a job—something he was more comfortable with.\n\n🧠 Lesson #3: The Best Co-founder Might Be the One Who Says No\n✅ A thoughtful “no” is more valuable than a careless “yes.”\n❌ Don’t choose a co-founder just because they’re available.\n🚩 Someone who agrees too quickly without understanding the grind is a red flag.\n💡 The person who turns you down today might become the right co-founder later, when the timing—and mindset—is right.\n\nWhat qualities do you think are non-negotiable in a co-founder?\nLet’s talk in the comments 👇\n\nhashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#CoFounder hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Leadership hashtag#SelfAwareness hashtag#365DaysOfStories",

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 35 – Should You Leave a Job Without Clarity on What's Next?\n\nIn the last 10 years, I have changed 5 jobs. Except for one, I left every single one without having a clear plan for what’s next.\n\nThe only thing I knew?\n❌ This job wasn’t working for me, and I was unhappy.\n\nWas it the right decision? I don’t know.\nBut I can tell you this—every time I sat in an interview, my career stories got more attention than my engineering leadership skills.\n\n🎯 The Interview That Changed My Perspective\nTake my interview for Aadhaar (UIDAI - Govt. of India) as Head of Technology.\nI was sitting across two of the greatest minds—Pramod Varma & Vivek Raghavan—for an hour-long conversation.\n\nFor the first 30 minutes, we discussed my experience leading teams and building technology. Then my entrepreneurial journey with Parift Ride came up.\n\nDr. Pramod immediately asked,\n💡 \"Why didn’t you talk about this earlier?\"\n\nI hesitated and said,\n🛑 \"It wasn’t a successful venture, so I wasn’t sure if it was relevant.\"\n\nHis response?\n✅ \"It’s one of the best things anyone can do—it shows courage and a determination to solve great problems.\"\n\nThe next 30 minutes were all about my entrepreneurial journey. I walked out of that room with the job.\n\n🔥 Bold Decisions Set You Apart\nLooking back, I realize one thing—what set me apart in interviews wasn’t just my engineering leadership skills, but the bold decisions I made throughout my career:\n\n➡️ Leaving jobs without a plan, simply because I knew they weren’t right for me.\n➡️ Turning around critical projects by making high-stakes decisions when things were on the edge.\n➡️ Venturing into entrepreneurship multiple times, despite the uncertainty.\n\nEvery bold decision added to my story—one that interviewers found far more compelling than a list of skills on my résumé.\n\n💭 Final Thought\nSo, should you leave a job without knowing what’s next?\n🔹 If you have clarity on what you don’t want, that’s sometimes enough.\n🔹 If you can make bold moves, opportunities will follow.\n🔹 And if nothing else—you’ll have stories worth telling.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts—have you ever taken a bold leap in your career? 🚀\n\nhashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#BoldDecisions hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Aadhaar hashtag#UIDAI hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Startups hashtag#JobChange hashtag#365DaysOfStories",

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 34 🌟 When Numbers Speak Louder Than Dreams\n\nEntrepreneurship, they say, is a rollercoaster. It’s thrilling, exhausting, and sometimes humbling. My Day 34 story is a deep dive into the realities of turning dreams into viable business models—and how the numbers often hold the final verdict.\n\nAfter experimenting with multiple strategies to encourage car owners to offer rides regularly on my ride-sharing platform, I faced an undeniable truth: none of them had yielded the results I had hoped for. The incentives weren’t enticing enough, and the engagement remained lackluster. This prompted me to step back, put my emotions aside, and approach the problem analytically. I decided to run the numbers—calculating the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Lifetime Value (LTV) of my customers to evaluate whether the business could truly be viable.\n\n💡 The Strategy: I came up with an idea to partner with 3M for free car interior cleaning in exchange for users downloading the app and committing to a minimum number of rides per month. With a general cleaning cost of ₹1500, I estimated that I could negotiate a bulk deal for ₹1000 per car if I signed on 200 cars.\n\n🔢 The Math:\n\nLTV = ₹60/month/customer x 12 months = ₹720.\n\nCAC for one apartment complex = 200 cars x ₹1000 = ₹20L. Even with a year of operations, I projected a 30% loss—a significant ₹6L deficit. The numbers were clear: at the unit economics level, the business wasn’t viable.\n\n💼 The Turning Point: Despite the discouraging math, I decided to give it one last try. I applied to NSRCEL at IIM Bangalore, where I had an exploratory meeting with an incredible 85-year-old mentor, Mr. Mehta. When I asked how I could secure funding, he offered me this wisdom: \"The world has changed—no one invests in ideas anymore. Show repeat customers for 6 months, and investors will follow.\"\n\nHowever, achieving this would require self-investment—₹20L for 200 repeat customers over 6 months. Though he offered incubation at NSRCEL, I politely declined, as I needed funding more than guidance.\n\n🤔 The Hard Choice After days of deliberation, I faced one of the toughest decisions of my life. I could either invest ₹20L of my own money to give Parift another chance, knowing I might lose ₹6L within a year, or close the business and walk away. Ultimately, I couldn’t justify the loss, and I made the heartbreaking decision to shut down Parift Ride, my first entrepreneurial venture.\n\n💡 The Takeaway: Shutting Parift was not the end—it was an invaluable learning experience. I realized I needed to deepen my understanding of business dynamics and decided to join a small startup to learn how seasoned entrepreneurs navigate challenges.\n\nThat’s how Parift Ride came to an end, but the lessons I learned have stayed with me—and they’ve been worth every challenge I faced.\n\nHave you ever had to shut down something close to your heart after putting in significant effort? I would love to hear your story.",

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 33 🌟 Chasing a Dream, One Apartment at a Time\n\nEntrepreneurship is a journey full of trial, error, and growth. My Day 33 story is one of persistence, creativity, and invaluable lessons learned along the way.\n\nAfter setting up multiple pickup zones with a proper display of the carpooling option, I focused my efforts on aggressively promoting my ride-sharing app within my apartment complex. What followed was a series of strategies designed to get neighbors on board with my ride-sharing app.\n\n💡 Morning Hustle: From 7:30 AM to 10 AM, I pitched my product to commuters waiting at the main gate for their office or private cabs. The initial reception? Disheartening. Many ignored me, thinking I was just another salesperson. But I didn’t give up—I introduced myself as the founder of the startup and a fellow resident. This helped me grab attention, but meaningful conversations were scarce due to the morning rush.\n\n🚗 Evening Pursuit: In the evenings, I approached car owners in the parking lot as they returned home. These interactions were slightly better—people had more time to listen. However, the spark of interest wasn’t enough to create momentum.\n\n🏠 Door-to-Door Visits: Not one to back down, I took it further by visiting individual apartments on weekends. Starting with my block of 80 apartments (part of a larger complex with 1,500 homes), I spoke to neighbors personally. This yielded better results—some downloaded the app immediately, and a few showed enthusiasm. Yet, ride matches weren’t happening due to a lack of users. To make the system work, I realized I needed at least 100 active sign-ups in my block.\n\n🎯 Incentives: To encourage daily ride-sharing—whether matches occurred or not—I launched a rewards program:\n\n1️⃣ ✨ Free parking across Bangalore for offering 5 rides a week.\n2️⃣ ⛽ 5% cashback on fuel for completing 20 rides a month.\n\nI marketed these incentives enthusiastically on our residents’ Facebook group, hoping to spark daily activity. But after 3-4 months of effort, participation remained low, and the rewards weren’t enough to motivate sustained action.\n\n🌟 Lessons Learned: Incentives alone weren’t enough to create lasting engagement. To truly ignite interest, I realized I needed a stronger pull and significant upfront investment to make ride-sharing irresistible—a bold leap I’m ready to take.\n\nThe journey continues as I prepare to take decisive action to turn my vision into reality. Stay tuned for the next chapter in my story.\n\nHave you ever faced a moment where sheer persistence taught you lessons you’ll never forget? I’d love to hear your story in the comments!",

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 31 - A Bold Pivot to Fix My Startup’s Core Problem! \n\nAfter weeks of hustling, pitching, and refining, three key questions kept bothering me:\n\n1️⃣ Ride seekers were mostly bus & two-wheeler commuters.\n2️⃣ Car owners didn’t see a big reason to offer rides.\n3️⃣ How was my app different from QuickRide, SRide, etc.? What was my USP?\n\nAnd when I took a step back, I had a realization that changed everything.\n\n❌ The Traffic Problem I Wasn’t Solving\nMy core goal was to reduce traffic congestion.\n\nBut if bus commuters or two-wheeler riders shifted to cars, it wouldn’t reduce cars on the road—it would just move people from one mode of transport to another.\n\n📊 80% of road space is consumed by cars.\n🛵 Only 20% is used by two-wheelers & buses.\n\nIf I truly wanted to reduce traffic, I had to make car owners share rides with each other—not just fill up their seats with bus riders.\n\n🤔 Why Car Owners Weren’t Interested\nMost ride-sharing apps (QuickRide, SRide, etc.) work on a simple exchange—car owners get a little money in return for offering rides.\n\nBut here’s the problem:\n💰 Car owners don’t care about saving ₹5K per month when they’ve already spent ₹10L on a car.\n🚗 For most, their car is a comfort & privacy zone, not a money-making tool.\n\nI needed a fundamental shift in my business model.\n\n🚀 The Big Pivot: Making Ride-Sharing Exclusive for Car Owners\nI changed my entire approach—my app would now be exclusive to car owners.\n\nHere’s why this was game-changing:\n✅ Rides would be shared among equals (no awkward pairing of a 35-year-old car owner with a GenZ commuter blasting music 🎧).\n✅ Mutual respect—when both people own cars, they understand the responsibility of keeping it clean and comfortable.\n✅ A true give-and-take system—if you take a ride today, you’re expected to offer one tomorrow.\n\n💡 And most importantly—this actually reduced cars on the road!\n\nWith a clear strategy, I now had to tackle the next big challenge:\n👉 How do I finally get a ride matched?\n\n(📢 Stay tuned for what's next)\n\n💬 What’s the biggest business pivot you’ve made?

Still a Long Way to Go!\n\nNow that my app was exclusive to car owners, I needed to solve the biggest challenge:\n👉 How do I get a ride matched?\n\n🎯 A New Approach: Hyperlocal Marketing\nI realized the real problem was user volume and density at a given location.\n\nInstead of marketing everywhere, I focused on one area at a time—within a 500m radius or a specific apartment complex.\n\n📍 I started with two massive apartments in Whitefield:\n🏢 Prestige Shantiniketan – 2000 apartments\n🏢 Brigade Metropolis – 2000 apartments\n\nI spent ₹10,000 on paid ads within these communities, confident I’d get a decent user base.\n\nBut the results? 😳\n📉 Only 4-5 users signed up.\n💸 Customer acquisition cost (CAC) = ₹2,000 per user! (Insanely unsustainable!)\n\nAnd even after onboarding 5 users…\n❌ Still no ride matches.\n\n🛑 Rethinking My Marketing Strategy\nI knew I needed more than just ads—I needed community influence.\n\nSo, I dropped external apartments and focused on my own apartment (600 residents).\nI tried everything—talking to people, networking, spreading awareness.\n\nBut nothing was working.\n\nI realized I wasn’t having enough influence on the residents’ association, which controlled key decisions.\n\n🏡 The Boldest Move: Shifting My Home for My Startup!\nI made a drastic decision—I moved to my own home in Electronic City, where I could have better control over community decisions.\n\n🚗 This move came at a cost.

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 30 - When I Took My Startup to the Streets—Literally!\n\nAfter launching my ride-sharing app, I quickly realized one harsh truth:\n👉 Without enough users, no rides would ever get matched.\n\nI needed to market my product. But there was a BIG problem…\n\n❌ No capital for paid ads.\n❌ No experience in digital marketing.\n✅ But I had determination—and that was enough to start!\n\n🎯 The Hustle Begins: Selling on the Streets\n\nWithin 2-3 days, I hit the ground running.\n📍 First stop: Inorbit Mall, Whitefield (Bangalore).\n\nI dropped my wife at work and walked into the mall, ready to pitch my app.\n\nBut…\n😬 I felt awkward stopping strangers.\n😵 I had no idea how to start conversations.\n\nStill, I tried.\n👥 Me: “Do you have a few minutes?”\n🚶‍♂️ People: “It’s about what?”\n⏳ Them: “Sorry, I’m getting late.”\n\nI quickly realized that one-on-one pitching wasn’t working.\n\n🧠 Strategy Shift: Targeting Groups\n\nInstead of chasing individuals, I started looking for groups—especially outside restaurants.\nI walked up and said:\n👉 \"Hey guys, do you mind if I take a few minutes of your time?\"\n\nI pitched my product, handed out pamphlets, and asked them to download the app.\n\nBut after days of hustling, the results were disappointing:\n❌ Few downloads.\n❌ Even fewer ride requests.\n❌ And still—no ride matches!\n\n🔄 Adapting Again: Moving to IT Parks\n\nI realized:\n🕛 Malls only had crowds during lunch.\n🛍️ Families & couples weren’t interested in interruptions.\n\nSo, I switched locations. My next stop?\n🏢 ITPL – a massive software park.\n\n🔥 The Smoker’s Pitch\n\nI found my audience in smoking zones & tea stalls:\n\nMornings & afternoons: Talking to individuals in smoking areas.\n\nEvenings: Approaching groups over tea.\n\nThis time, I refined my pitch. Instead of asking them to download, I asked for feedback.\n\n💡 Key Realizations:\n1️⃣ Ride seekers were mostly bus & two-wheeler commuters.\n2️⃣ Car owners didn’t see a big reason to offer rides.\n3️⃣ Everyone kept asking:\n👉 \"How is this different from QuickRide, SRide, etc.?\"\n\nAnd no matter what I said, my USP wasn’t clicking.\n\n❓ The Big Questions That Kept Me Up at Night\n\n1️⃣ How do I make car owners excited about sharing rides?\n2️⃣ How do I finally get a ride matched—after one whole month?\n\nI knew I had to think differently and tweak my product.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what I did next… (I’ll share that tomorrow!)\n\n💬 Have you ever tried selling something to strangers?

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 37 – A Co-Founder Must Share Your Hunger\n\nAfter my first attempt at finding a co-founder didn’t work out, we parted ways. But a month later, we reconnected.\n\nOver lunch, we reflected on what went wrong.\nHe admitted:\n“I wasn’t fully convinced about our first business idea—that’s why I was just following your lead.”\n\nThat made sense.\nSo, we decided to try again.\n\nThis time, we set some ground rules:\n✅ We would pick an idea that excited both of us.\n✅ We would both bring relevant skills to the table.\n\n🌾 The New Business Idea: Fixing Price Fluctuations for Farmers\nOne major problem we saw: farmers suffer from unpredictable price fluctuations.\nFor example, tomato prices can swing drastically due to supply-demand gaps.\n\nWe believed we could solve this by creating predictability in demand to ensure stable prices for farmers.\n\nWe got to work.\n\nFor weeks, we brainstormed, researched, and refined our approach.\n\nThen, we attended a Millets Expo in Bangalore, eager to validate our idea with farmers and industry experts.\n\nThat’s when reality hit us:\n💡 We had zero domain knowledge.\n\nWithout deep industry expertise, we knew this wasn’t a problem we could solve effectively.\n\n⚡ The Bigger Issue: Different Speeds, Different Goals\nAt this point, I was ready to pivot again and explore new opportunities.\n\nBut I noticed a pattern:\n👉 I was driven to move fast, iterate, and find the next opportunity.\n👉 He was content to take things slow and see where it goes.\n\nI realized we were running at two different speeds.\n\nSo, I had an honest conversation with him.\nI said: “I don’t think we’re aligned in how we want to build a business.”\nHe agreed: “Yeah, I’m looking for a more balanced life right now.”\n\nWe parted ways again—this time, with mutual understanding.\n\n🏆 Lesson #2: A Co-Founder Must Match Your Energy and Ambition\n❌ A co-founder should not just be a good friend or ex-colleague.\n✅ A co-founder should have the same level of hunger, urgency, and vision as you do.\n❌ Don’t look for a co-founder just because the journey is lonely.\n\nFinding the right co-founder is harder than it looks.\nI still don’t know the perfect way to do it.\n\nHow did you find (or struggle to find) the right co-founder?

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 28 - A Strong Partnership and Global Expansion\n\nAfter aligning with my counterpart at the customer’s side, we made it clear: no blame game. Our focus was on ensuring the project came out of the crisis and went live before the existing vendor's contract expired.\n\nMy counterpart on the customer side was a strong technical leader, and together we formed a dynamic partnership. With over 10 systems to integrate, we shifted from using stubs to real system integrations, tackling one issue at a time.\n\n⚙️ The Integration Phase: Real Systems, Real Progress\n\nWith the integration of real systems, the project finally began to function from an integration perspective. We started hitting the real APIs and resumed UAT (User Acceptance Testing). However, things didn’t go smoothly. The business users started testing, and they were not happy. They pointed out several functional bugs.\n\nThe clock was ticking, and we also had a timezone gap to deal with. If we followed the standard bug-fixing timeline, we would never clear UAT on time. So, we made a bold decision, which was expensive but the fastest option during the UAT phase.\n\n✈️ The Bold Move: Sending Top Team Members to the Customer's International Location\n\nWe sent our top 2 team members to the customer’s location, and that’s when the magic happened. They were able to fix bugs on the spot and also educate the customer on how the system worked. We began working almost round the clock in 3 shifts to catch up.\n\nThis allowed us to move forward quickly, and soon, the customer started to appreciate our partnership. But, as things progressed, they realized that most of the blocking issues were on their side, not ours.\n\n👥 A Strong Leader on the Customer's Side\n\nGiven that our product involved integration with many internal systems, the customer decided to bring in a very senior leader to help navigate the cross-team dependencies.\n\nI must say, he was one of the finest leaders I’ve worked with. In every turnaround I’ve experienced, there’s always been a strong senior leader on the customer side who plays a critical role in stitching teams together. Navigating internal teams at the customer side is never easy without their top leader's support.\n\nWe had daily meetings where more than 10 teams would join to discuss interdependencies and work on the timeline to keep things moving.\n\n💪 The UAT Phase and the Final Push\n\nWe spent almost 3 months in the UAT phase, and finally, after 6 months of hard work, the project went live. It was a collaborative effort, with intense work across both our teams and theirs.\n\n🌍 A Strong Partnership and Global Expansion\n\nThrough this process, we built one of the strongest partnerships at the leadership layer, and the project went live across 5 countries. This was one of the best engagements for us in terms of global expansion and was a testament to how powerful teamwork and partnership can be in a crisis.",

    "content": "📖 365 Days of Stories: Day 29: 🚀 My First Entrepreneurial Journey—Left Incomplete, But Revived After 2 Years!\n\nI’ve shared many turnaround stories, but today, let me take you back to my first entrepreneurial attempt—one that didn’t go as planned.\n\n💡 The Idea: Solving Traffic Congestion\nI wanted to tackle a universal problem—traffic congestion.\nSo, I spent nearly a year building a ride-sharing product. But before I could launch it, financial constraints forced me to put my dream on hold and return to a corporate job.\n\n⏳ 2 Years of Regret (2016-2017)\nWhile working in the corporate world, I often spoke about my startup experience. But every time I did, I felt a deep regret—like carrying a child for nine months but never bringing it into the world.\n\nThen one day, I said to myself:\n👉 “It’s time to finish what I started.”\n\n🎯 The Comeback – Quitting My Job Again!\nI took the bold step once more—I quit my job to finally launch the product.\nBut there was one problem…\n\n❌ I had always been a backend developer\n❌ I had zero frontend experience\n❌ UI/UX was completely new to me\n\nInstead of wasting time & money on design, I decided to keep it simple.\nI took inspiration from Google Maps, Uber, LiftO, and Facebook and got to work!\n\n🛠️ 3 Months of Relentless Execution\n⏳ Every single day counted.\n💻 I taught myself Android development\n📱 Designed & built a fully functional mobile app\n🚀 Finally, on February 14, I launched the product! (An auspicious day, as my mother said 😊)\n\n🎉 The Launch & The Big Realization\nExcited, I told my wife: “Inform your office colleagues to use my app!”\nShe asked me a simple, yet powerful question:\n\n“When they request a ride, how will it get matched?” 🤯\n\nThat hit me.\nI thought, “Once we have enough users, ride-matching will happen naturally.”\n\nBut then…\n⏳ Days passed.\n⏳ Weeks passed.\nWe onboarded around 30-40 users from personal connections…\n\n🚫 Not a single ride was getting matched.\n\n🔍 What Went Wrong?\nThe answer was simple but painful:\n👉 We didn’t have enough ride-givers on the platform.\n\nI realized:\n✅ Tech alone isn’t enough—market adoption matters.\n✅ Building is one thing, but getting users is another.\n✅ No matter how great the product is, without users, it’s just code.\n\nSo, I had to figure out marketing & growth… and that’s what I did next.\n\nWhat happened after that? I’ll share tomorrow. Stay tuned!",

    "content": "🎯 365 Days of Stories: Day 36 – The Wrong Co-Founder Can Slow You Down\n\nWhen I started my first entrepreneurial journey, I was a solo founder. I often felt that having a co-founder would have made things easier.\n\nSo, when I decided to start my second venture, my top priority wasn’t the business idea—it was finding the right co-founder.\n\n🔥 The Quick Agreement That Led to a Slow Realization\nOne day, I was catching up with a friend and ex-colleague who had just lost his job—not by choice, but due to post-COVID cost-cutting.\n\nWhen he told me about his situation, I immediately asked:\n\n👉 “Would you like to do business with me?”\n\nWithout hesitation, he replied: “Why not!”\n\nI was excited but cautious.\nI told him: “Let’s sit down and discuss everything first—our roles, responsibilities, equity, profits, and expectations.”\n\nWe met at a café and talked for four hours.\nTo my surprise, he didn’t ask many questions.\nHe simply said: “I’m fine, let’s get started.”\n\nSomething felt off.\n\nStarting a business is a huge commitment, and not asking questions was a red flag. But I brushed it aside, thinking maybe he was just being flexible.\n\n🚀 The Early Days: Me Talking, Him Listening\n👉 We got a co-working space and spent the first few days getting to know each other—both personally and professionally.\n👉 I shared a business idea: Providing premium IT services to mid-sized companies at a premium price—inspired by my time at ThoughtWorks.\n👉 We aligned on company culture—wanting to build a boutique firm that prioritized quality over scale.\n\nBut soon, something became painfully clear.\n\nFor three weeks, I did all the thinking, strategizing, and planning.\nHe only asked questions based on what I presented—but never initiated ideas.\n\nAt first, I told myself, “Maybe he just needs more time.”\nBut after a month, I realized:\n\n💡 I didn’t need an advisor—I needed a co-founder.\n\nSo, I brought it up. “I feel like I’m the only one driving this. I need you to contribute more.”\n\nInstead of discussing it, he got offended and said, “Maybe we’re not the right fit.”\nI suggested taking some time to figure things out, but he was done.\n\nI gave him a week to reconsider, but he stood by his decision.\n\n🏆 Lesson #1: The Wrong Co-Founder Is Worse Than No Co-Founder\n❌ A co-founder is not just someone who agrees with you.\n✅ A co-founder must bring fresh ideas, take ownership, and challenge you.\n❌ Don’t look for a co-founder just because the journey is lonely.\n\n👉 Have you ever faced a similar situation? Would love to hear your experiences! 🚀\n\nhashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#CoFounder hashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#365DaysOfStories",

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 27 - Restructuring for Success: Building the Right Team\n\nWhen I took control of the account, I knew I had to understand the team and the challenges before making any major moves. I spent the next few days interacting with everyone—literally each and every one of the 30 team members working on the project.\n\nI asked a few standard questions to gauge where we stood:\n\n❓ Questions to Understand the Team:\n\n🤔 What’s your role in the project?\n🖥️ Explain the module you are responsible for, including a code walkthrough.\n🛠️ What’s the problem you see in this project? Why are we stuck in this state for so long?\n\nThe goal was simple—understand:\n\n🧠 How well each person knew their system and their work.\n🧐 Their perspective on the project’s challenges.\n\nBased on these conversations, I categorized people into three main buckets:\n\n📊 People Categorization:\n\n✅ People who were good and could move the project forward.\n🚫 People who were good but would act as a deterrent to progress.\n❌ People who lacked the right skills and weren’t contributing effectively.\n\nIn just 2-3 days of one-on-one discussions, I was clear about the changes that had to happen. The project needed a restructured team, and here’s what that meant:\n\n🛠️ Team Restructuring Plan:\n\n👥 Bring in trusted team members from previous projects who could contribute significantly.\n❌ Let go of people who weren’t adding value—whether they were good or bad.\n📈 Elevate capable people from the existing team to leadership roles.\n\nI quickly made these changes over the next 1-2 days, and by the end, the team understood that I had full authority to make decisions. It was clear: it was do or die. Either we pull this project off in the next 2 months, or people would be out of a job. As a small startup, we couldn’t afford dead weight.\n\nThe team was now aligned—everyone was committed to giving 200% to make this work.\n\n⚙️ Aligning with the Customer - No Sugarcoating\n\nWith the internal team sorted, I started joining every customer meeting—technical and management meetings alike. My purpose was simple: understand the customer’s perspective on where we were stuck and what could be done to move things forward.\n\nI made it clear to everyone—no sugarcoating in crisis. I had to be blunt, even in front of the customer. During one of the calls, I told them, “We need to start fresh and explain the requirements properly again. We are not clear on the requirements so far.”\n\nThe customer responded, “How can you say in the UAT phase that you're not clear on the requirements?”\n\nI responded plainly, “That’s the truth. Either we fix it now, or we can play the blame game. The choice is ours.”\n\nThe customer quickly recognized that I was a new leader, here to fix things and save the ship from sinking. I had full access to the top leadership on their side, and we were clear: no blame game. We both needed to do everything to make this project live.\n\nStay tuned for what's next.\n\nhashtag#CrisisManagement hashtag#Leadership",

    "content": "🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 26 - Turning Around a Global Enterprise Account in 2 Months\n\nAs of now, I have shared turnaround stories of 3 accounts, and now let’s talk about another critical one.\n\n🏢 The Challenge: A Global Enterprise Struggling with Slow Progress\n\nA multinational enterprise customer had signed up to roll out an application across many countries, committing to our product for its customization capabilities and the promise to replace an existing vendor’s product.\n\nBut here’s the catch: the existing vendor had a major flaw. Change requests took over 6 months to implement. By the time they were completed, they were no longer relevant. This was a massive pain point for the customer.\n\nOur product had a clear USP—speed of change requests and competitive pricing. We promised the customer we could go live in 3-6 months, with some minor customizations and integration with their core systems.\n\nBut things didn’t go as planned.\n\n⏳ The Roadblock: 12 Months of Struggles\n\nWhat was expected to be a 3-month timeline turned into 1 year. The project was stuck at the integration testing stage, and the core issue was that most of the flows hadn’t even been integrated with the customer’s systems. We were testing on stubs, and there were too many bugs in the system.\n\nTo make matters worse, the customer’s contract with the existing vendor was about to renew. If the project didn’t go live, the customer would be forced to sign up for another year of support with the existing vendor—a huge cost that would add no value to their migration. The customer gave us an ultimatum: Go live in the next 2 months, or the contract is canceled.\n\nFor the customer, this was just another contract, but for us, it was our entry into the global market—a massive opportunity.\n\n⚠️ The Turnaround: Time to Step In\n\nThat’s when my CEO realized I needed to step in. He knew my expertise in turning around struggling accounts, but pulling me from another project was not going to be easy. However, given the urgency of the situation, he had no choice.\n\nThis account had a team of 30 people, many of whom had been hired specifically for this project. The project was being led by a former boss of mine, making the situation even more delicate.\n\nBut I knew the only way to turn this around was to take full control and make tough decisions. I couldn’t afford to please everyone—I had to do what was necessary.\n\n💪 The Bold Decision: Full Control\n\nI told my CEO, “I can’t take a supporting role. I need full authority to drive this project. The goal is yours, but the path is mine.”\n\nHe agreed, knowing we had only 2 months left to save this project. The stakes were high, and failure wasn’t an option.\n\n🤔 What Would You Do?\nHave you ever been in a situation where you had to take full control to turn a project around? How did you handle it?\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day26 hashtag#ElevateIdea hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#TurnaroundStory hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#HighPressure hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#GlobalExpansion",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories - Day 25: Navigating Hiring Challenges & Building a Strong Team\n\nWith 4 freshers joining in a week, the focus shifted to hiring 2-3 senior folks to handle the workload for long-term stability.\n\nI asked the recruiter to help me find senior candidates with 8-12 years of experience who could join immediately or within a month. However, most candidates struggled to clear even basic programming tests. I was clear: we needed hands-on talent with strong programming skills.\n\n💡 Hiring Challenges\nWe conducted weekend drives but still couldn’t find anyone passing the test. My recruiter wasn’t happy, so we changed our approach. I said, “Let’s focus on candidates from well-reputed companies. If we need to wait 2-3 months, so be it, but we need the right talent.”\n\n🔍 The New Approach\nWe began receiving better candidates skilled in programming. I realized that, as a non-big brand, attracting perfect candidates in all areas would be tough. So, I decided that programming and design were non-negotiable, while other skills could be flexible.\n\n🎯Securing the Right Talent\nWe finalized 2-3 senior candidates and offered them more than they asked for, ensuring no last-minute rejections. This process took almost a month. Meanwhile, I continued training the freshers and worked on key bugs to improve the 3 KPIs we agreed on with the customer.\n\n📈  Progress & Improvements\nAfter another month, we saw notable improvements:\n\n🔹 Transaction SLA – We reached 95-97% success in T+1 day processing.\n🔹 Response Time – We fixed the response time issue, and the system performed well even at peak times.\n🔹 Team Growth – We had fresh grads contributing to the team.\n🔹 Senior Hires – We finalized 2 senior hires who would join in 2-3 months.\n\nThe customer removed the threat of contract cancellation, and our CEO was happy with our progress.\n\n🎮 Taking Full Control\nWith the CTO moving to another project, I took full charge of the account. But I realized juggling design, training, and management was getting difficult.\n\n🧑‍💼 Hiring a Project Manager\nI decided to hire a Project Manager to handle day-to-day operations, allowing me to focus on big-ticket items. I was fortunate to hire someone within a week. He shared that this was his first corporate job after running his own venture for 10 years. I was sold by his entrepreneurial experience, and having gone through the same journey, I respected him immensely. I offered him more than he asked for, and he joined us within a week.\n\n💡 The Key Lesson\nOne important lesson I learned from hiring—whether freshers or seniors—is never take advantage of someone’s situation. Pay them fairly based on what they deserve, not what they ask or their previous salary. This principle has helped me build strong employee loyalty.\n\n👉 What are your thoughts on fair compensation and hiring practices?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories - Day 24: Team Ramp-Up Strategy – Hiring Fresh Talent Quickly\n\nAs I continued to address the major issues with the project, I quickly realized I couldn’t run the show alone for much longer. We needed to ramp up the team fast, but there were several constraints:\n\n💡 Hiring Challenges\n\n⏳ No time to wait 3 months for hiring.\n💰 We couldn’t pay above market rates.\n🔍 We weren’t a big brand, so attracting top talent was a challenge.\nSo, I did what any startup would do: I got creative.\n\n🏫The NCST Solution\n\nI went to NCST (now merged with CDAC)—the same institute where I had completed my post-graduation. Just a few years ago, I had been declined to hire from there because I didn’t have my company registered, and my startup wasn’t well-established yet. But this time, things were different.\n\nI approached the placement officer and said, “I represent a private limited company with 200+ people, and we’re looking to hire 5 people immediately.” She agreed and told me, “You can come anytime. We have over 100 candidates about to pass out in 2 weeks.”\n\n📄 Interview Strategy\n\nMy approach was simple and focused on the basics, as I was the only one conducting interviews. Here’s the strategy I followed:\n\n1. 📑 No Cut-off Percentage – Don't worry about backlog in engineering or strict criteria on percentage. Everyone was welcome.\n2. ✏️ Programming Test – 2 questions on paper, no computers. Just raw logic, no need to worry about cheating or extreme test cases.\n3. 💻 Any Language – Candidates could use any programming language of their choice.\n\nIn just 2 hours, I conducted the test, and within 1-2 hours, I reviewed the papers, shortlisting around 10-15 candidates based on the quality of their logic, regardless of whether the solutions were fully correct.\n\n🕒 The Interview Day\n\nI interviewed all the candidates until 9 pm that day and selected 4 who showed promise. I initially offered them a 6-month probation with ₹15,000/month, transitioning to ₹3L/annum after that. To minimize risk and secure the talent quickly, I modified the offer to ₹3L/annum from day one, with no probation. Everyone agreed to join in just 1 week.\n\n🧑‍🎓 The Freshers Strategy\n\nI was clear: I would have 4 freshers joining in 1 week, and with some training, they could start contributing in 1 month. With the initial team sorted out as a helping hand, now I started thinking about hiring senior folks who could handle the heavy lifting. I’ll talk about that strategy tomorrow.\n\n👉 Have you ever had to ramp up a team quickly under tough conditions? What strategy did you use to attract the right talent?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories - Day 23: Tackling Major Issues – Customer Demands & Focused Priorities\n\nAfter a month of fixing major bugs, the customer was cautiously optimistic. While progress had been made, the problem wasn’t solved. The SLA required 99% success within T+1 days, but we were at 85%. The backlog still contained over a month’s worth of unprocessed transactions, creating massive concerns.\n\n💡 The Pressure Was Real\nEvery transaction was financial, and delays were creating major issues for end users, significantly reducing customer satisfaction. The stakes were high, and time was running out.\n\n📊 The Sr. VP Meeting\n\nAs the situation worsened, the Sr. VP called for a fortnightly meeting with both customer leadership and ours. The room was intense, with customer leaders demanding quick solutions to every issue.\n\nI was the only senior person on the team, supported by just 2-3 junior engineers. I knew we couldn’t solve everything at once, and this would be a long journey. The weight of the situation was heavy, and I needed to communicate the reality to the customer leadership.\n\n💬 Honesty in Crisis\n\nFrom my previous turnaround experiences, I learned a key lesson: when projects are in crisis, never lie or sugarcoat things. Be transparent with the top decision-maker—that’s the only way out. With this in mind, I decided to be honest during the meeting.\n\nI addressed the Sr. VP directly: “We can’t solve everything at once. We need to prioritize the top 3 KPIs to track our progress.”\n\nI wasn’t there to make false promises. We needed focus, and I had to make the leadership understand that if we didn’t prioritize the right issues, we’d be wasting time. We agreed on three critical KPIs:\n\n🔹 Transaction Processing SLA – Currently at 85%, goal 99%.\n 🔹 Backlog – 1 month vs. T+1 day.\n 🔹 Response Time During Peak Load – System performance was poor during peak load, requiring restarts.\n\nWe decided to focus on these three KPIs and set aside other issues. This gave me the clarity to focus on what truly mattered.\n\n💼 The Reality of Running the Show Alone\n\nWhile the focus was helpful, I knew I couldn’t do this alone. We needed more hands on deck. However, we had constraints: no bench strength, we weren’t a big brand to attract top talent, and we couldn’t offer sky-high salaries.\n\nThe team was small and stretched thin, and time was running out. But we had to prioritize, and I had to lead through the tough times. That will be the focus for Day 24—our ramp-up strategy.\n\n👉 Have you ever had to focus on a few key priorities during a crisis and align your team to deliver on them? How did you approach it?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories - Day 22: Another Turnaround Story – A New Product, High Stakes, and a Failing System\n\nLet’s talk about another turnaround story for an enterprise account. We had spent almost a year customizing our new product and migrating data from the previous vendor. One month before go-live, I joined the account as the account owner. The team was small—15-20 people—comprising 6-7 developers, 4 testers, 2-3 operations folks, and 2 DBAs.\n\nIn the first month, I focused on understanding the technical and business details while UAT testing was ongoing. The project went live, but the outcome wasn’t great. 🚨\n\n💡 The Reality:\n📊 Expected SLA: 99% of transactions should be processed within T+1 days.\n⚠️ Actual performance: 60-65%.\n⏳ Backlog: 1 month.\n\nThe first month, the customer was silent, assuming it was just initial hiccups. But by the second month, things still weren’t stable, and patience started to run thin. The issue was escalated to the customer CEO level, and when that happens, the stakes are high. Time is limited. It’s make or break.\n\nA Few Key Challenges\n👩‍💻 Out of 6-7 developers, only 1 had 10+ years of experience. The rest were juniors with 2-3 years of experience.\n🚨 To make things worse, the senior developer and a couple of juniors left post-go-live, leaving us with mostly junior developers who lacked a holistic understanding of the system, especially with financial transactions.\n\nThe Sr. VP Meeting\n🗣️ The Sr. VP of the department called us for a meeting. Me, my CEO, CTO, and COO all went in. The message was clear: Fix it within 2 months, or we cancel the contract and roll it back to the previous vendor.\n\nAfter the meeting, I’ll never forget the conversation at Starbucks. ☕\nOur CEO turned to the CTO, COO, and me and asked, “Guys, it’s time for you to prove your worth. Tell me how we get out of this situation.”\n\nAfter a long pause, I said, “We don’t have anyone who understands the product inside and out. Someone needs to get into the code, understand the core issues, and fix them. That’s the only way out.”\n\nThen came the next question: Who’s going to do this?\nI said, “I can do this, but I need someone to manage the customer. I can’t handle both—customer and code.”\n\n💡 My CTO agreed to take over the customer side as the account owner, and I moved to the code.\n\nThe Fixing Begins\n💻 I dove into the code, identifying the major bugs that were affecting the system. It wasn’t easy—there was a lot to tackle, and the time was limited. But I didn’t focus on everything. I prioritized the biggest issues.\n\n🚀 After a month of focused work, we managed to fix a few top issues. The SLA improved from 60-65% to 85%. The customer was slightly more positive, but the problem wasn’t solved. There was still a long way to go, but we were on the right path.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n📅 The journey doesn’t end here. Stay tuned.\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day22 hashtag#Turnaround hashtag#Leadership hashtag#SLA hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 20: Fighting for Organization Goal & Navigating Internal Conflicts\n\nIn the pursuit of unlocking payments for the company, my focus was clear: ensure that CEO-driven projects were delivered on time and that the CEO’s confidence in us was restored. This became my sole mission. Every decision I made, every conversation I had, was aimed at achieving that one goal—delivering results for the CEO.\n\nWhile focused on delivering the CEO's priority projects and unlocking payments, I unintentionally made enemies—both internally and with the customer.\n\nWhen I spoke with my boss, he kept reiterating that the goal was to make CEO-driven projects live. He told me to stay focused on that goal, and he would take care of the rest. This provided some relief, and I continued pushing forward.\n\nWeek by week, we made visible progress. By the end of six months, most of the CEO’s priority projects had gone live, and the CEO’s confidence in our team was fully restored. Not only did we secure the trust of the leadership, but we also unlocked payments for the previous two quarters, totaling approximately $15 million USD. It felt like a huge win for the company and for the team.\n\nHowever, behind the scenes, things weren’t so straightforward. While the people directly aligned with the organizational goal were happy with the results, others weren’t. Some internal leaders—especially the Architect Leader and the Process QA Leader—were unhappy that I had full control over their teams and that they couldn’t intervene. Additionally, a few BU leaders didn’t appreciate that I had direct CEO support and that they no longer had the same level of influence.\n\nIt was a strange mix of emotions. On one hand, I felt proud to have made a major contribution to the company by unlocking millions in payments and earning the CEO’s trust. On the other hand, I knew I had created some internal friction that would eventually come to the surface. I felt that I had done the right thing for the organization, but at what cost?\n\nWhat’s the biggest challenge you’ve faced when aligning internal teams with organizational goals?\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day20 hashtag#Leadership hashtag#OrganizationalPolitics hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#TurningCrisisAround hashtag#CEOTrust hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 21: Leadership Conflicts & The Hardest Decision I Had to Make\n\nAs we shifted focus to the next level of projects, I knew we needed a long-term strategy for success, not just firefighting. I asked my boss why the architects couldn’t report to me, given that I was accountable for the entire delivery. His answer was strange: “Build your own architect team and don’t worry about the existing one.”\n\nAt the time, I didn’t fully understand the implications of this advice, but I trusted him and moved forward. We positioned our Tech Leads to take on architect roles, something they were very capable of. The issue, however, was that they didn’t have the authority to sign off on designs, so we were still dependent on the existing architects.\n\nEven though the Tech Leads controlled the design, we couldn’t bypass architect approvals. The architects weren’t happy with the leadership conflict impacting their work quality. They were only valuable if engaged by the development team for design, but since we were advised to build our own architect team, we started bypassing them.\n\nThis created tension between the architects and development team, and the customer soon noticed. Despite having 10 senior architects, their morale dropped as they were caught in the middle of a leadership conflict. I wasn’t happy, but felt helpless to fix it.\n\nI suspected my boss couldn’t challenge another leader who had been with the company for over seven years and was highly respected by the customer. This issue was affecting the entire account, but it seemed ignored.\n\nThen, nearly a year later, I received an email announcing that I would now report to my peer—the very person who had led the architect team. I was shocked. This wasn’t what I had been told, and it felt like a betrayal. I couldn’t accept it.\n\nIt wasn’t just about my dignity—it was about the team who had stood by me for the last 1.5 years. I couldn’t walk away and leave them vulnerable to poor leadership. My self-respect was at stake. I couldn’t just accept this for the sake of my job security.\n\nIf I were the old Partha, I might have just left and found another job. But this time, I decided to fight against the system. I felt that as the leader of a 130-person team, I couldn’t just abandon them under these circumstances. I had to escalate.\n\nI escalated the issue to my new super boss, who had recently taken over, but the response was not what I expected. I felt like I was fighting alone, and my team would be left behind in unsafe hands.\n\nAfter two months of struggling to change things, I made the difficult decision to leave the company. It wasn’t easy, especially after all the work I had put into the account. But in the end, I had to protect my integrity.\n\nThe biggest lesson learned: Don’t fight a battle if your boss isn’t equally fighting alongside you. It’s not worth it. Follow a leader who takes bigger risks than you, not one who stays on the sidelines.",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 19: Navigating Internal Resistance & Earning CEO’s Support\n\nWith in-person meeting issues resolved, we tackled another roadblock—getting architects actively involved in development instead of just signing off on designs at the end.\n\nYou’ll remember that the customer CEO had frozen our payments, and my super boss had given me veto power to engage anyone within the organization to turn the project around.\n\nStep 1: Architects Aligned, But Another Roadblock Emerged\n\nEven though architects didn’t report to me, I had full control to get them aligned. While there was initial resistance, their willingness to prioritize CEO-driven projects shifted their focus. They started contributing during development, not just in design approval.\n\n🚧 New Roadblock – Process QA Team 🚧\n\nJust when we thought we had momentum, another challenge surfaced. The Process QA team, responsible for enforcing SDLC compliance, wasn’t happy that we were bypassing documentation and approval steps. We weren’t ignoring quality—we were laser-focused on getting projects live ASAP.\n\nI spoke to the Process QA leader, explaining the need for exceptions and parallel execution. He understood but asked for a formal email taking responsibility for these exceptions.\n\n✔ I agreed.\n✔ The Process QA team aligned.\n✔ We moved forward.\n\nStep 2: The Next CEO Meeting – Make or Break\n\nA month passed. We had made significant progress, but none of the 10-15 high-priority projects had gone live yet. Some were in UAT, others stuck in customer design approvals—problems now on their side.\n\nI knew the upcoming CEO review meeting was critical. This time, all BU leaders would be present. When stakes are high, never sugarcoat issues to the top decision-maker.\n\nThe Meeting Begins...\nWe presented our progress transparently—where we made improvements and where projects were stuck. The CEO didn’t just push us—he challenged his own team too. He appreciated our progress, gave us direct access to escalate any issue, instructed everyone to prioritize these projects, and set up fortnightly meetings.\n\nStep 3: The Real Impact – Power & Resistance\n\nWith CEO backing, priority alignment, and clear escalation paths, the project was finally on track!\n\n🚧 But success comes with a price. 🚧\nInternally and externally, not everyone was happy. Some saw us as problem solvers, but others saw us as troublemakers. Challenging the status quo made enemies.\n\nThat’s what I’ll talk about tomorrow—the resistance we faced, both within our company and from the customer’s side.\n\n👉 Have you ever faced backlash for driving change?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 17: When Customer Leader Priorities Clash with CEO Directives\n\nNow that I had merged the Development & Maintenance teams, I thought the last challenge was resolving billing issues and aligning customer priorities.\n\nComing from a large MNC, I assumed if the CEO set a priority, everyone would follow it like a bible—aligning BU leaders should be a cakewalk.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nStep 1: Reality Check – BU Leaders Had Their Own Priorities\nI set up meetings with 5-6 BU leaders, expecting alignment on the CEO’s initiatives. But instead, I heard:\n\n💬 \"The CEO has priorities, but we have our own BU-level goals. We can’t drop everything for his initiatives.\"\n\n💬 \"Billing isn’t our problem. If your support team lacks skills, replace them. But we won’t approve invoices if resources work outside their assigned stream.\"\n\nEach leader was aligned on their own priorities, not the CEO’s vision.\n\nStep 2: Navigating Internal Politics\nI went to my boss, explained the resistance, and asked for suggestions.\n\nHis response?\n💬 “That’s how it works here. It’s a massive org. You need to find your own way.”\n\nAt that moment, I realized a hidden truth—in CEO meetings, everyone nods in agreement, but on the ground, things don’t move as expected.\n\nSo, I made a tactical decision:\n\n🚀 Prioritize Production Stability\n🚀 Focus only on CEO’s priority projects\n🚀 Deprioritize everything else (regardless of BU alignment)\n\nWhether BU leaders supported it or not, this was the new game plan.\n\nStep 3: The Unexpected Challenge – Work Location Battles\nJust when I thought I was gaining control, another roadblock emerged.\n\nBU leaders wanted me and all Team Leads to attend their weekly meetings in person at the customer office.\n\n🚧 Problem?\n\nOur office was far from the customer location—each meeting meant losing half a day in travel.\nTeam Leads were critical for execution—leaving the office frequently would disrupt progress.\nVirtual meetings weren’t the norm back then (no Zoom culture).\nWe proposed alternative solutions:\n✅ Host meetings at our office\n✅ Switch to remote calls\n\n💬 Customer’s response? “No. You must be here in person.”\n\nStep 4: Finding a Creative Solution\nThis was turning into a tug-of-war between what was practical and what was expected.\n\nWe had to think outside the box—and that’s what I’ll reveal on Day 18.\n\n💡 Have you ever faced internal politics where leadership decisions didn’t align with ground realities?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 18: Navigating Conflicts – First the Customer, Now the Architects\n\nSo far, we’ve tackled misaligned priorities (CEO vs. BU leaders), billing, and meeting constraints.\n\nI had to pick my battles. I knew I couldn’t win them all.\n\nStep 1: The CEO vs. BU Leaders Conflict\n\nThe issue wasn’t that BU leaders ignored CEO priorities—they had additional projects they were equally invested in.\n\n🔹 Key Realization:\n✔ The CEO focused on high-impact, org-wide initiatives.\n✔ BU leaders focused on their own business unit goals.\n✔ They weren’t opposing the CEO; they just didn’t want their priorities deprioritized.\n\nThis meant we had to manage both CEO priorities and BU-level initiatives simultaneously—a near-impossible balancing act.\n\nStep 2: Solving the In-Person Meeting Problem\nOne of the biggest operational blockers was weekly meetings. The customer required me and my Tech Leads to attend multiple in-person meetings at different locations—consuming valuable time needed for execution.\n\n📍 The Problem:\n✔ We were accountable to five BU leaders - three demanded in-person meetings, and two were fine with remote.\n✔ In person meetings were on different days, consuming three full days a week just for travel.\n\n📍 The Proposal:\n💡 We proposed consolidating all three in-person meetings into one day, freeing up four full days per week for delivery.\n\n🚀 Result: The customer agreed! A small but crucial win, giving us much-needed breathing space.\n\nStep 3: Internal Bottlenecks – The Architect Roadblock\n\nWith more execution time, our own architect delays in approvals and lack of involvement during development slowed projects even more.\n\nFor the CEO, only go-live dates mattered.\n\nFor us, every phase was stuck in approval loops, slowing down progress.\n\nThe Architect Problem:\n🔹 Reported to another leader, not directly to me.\n🔹 Focused only on design approvals—not project delivery.\n🔹 Had no deadlines, while we were under immense pressure to deliver.\n🔹 Were not involved in development but still controlled post-development approvals.\n🔹 We needed them hands-on—not just reviewing designs but helping resolve issues and pushing projects forward.\n\n🚧 The Challenge? They weren’t aligned with our urgency.\n\nOur architects were senior, highly skilled professionals, but they saw their role as purely design-focused. Meanwhile, I needed them to partner with Tech Leads and development teams, staying engaged throughout the project lifecycle—not just signing off at the end.\n\nNow, we were navigating conflicts both externally (customer challenges) and internally (team misalignment).\n\nThe Bigger Question\nHow do you get teams to align when their incentives don’t match?\n\nThat’s for tomorrow.\n\n👉 Have you ever faced internal roadblocks that slowed down urgent deliverables?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 16: Restructuring Teams & Aligning Priorities in a Crisis\n\nContinuing from Day 15, where the CEO put payments on hold due to delays in high-priority projects, and I made the tough call to let go of 9 out of 11 managers—the real challenge now was execution.\n\n🔹 Internal restructuring was the easy part. The real battle was delivering results.\n\nStep 1: Identifying the Core Problems\nWe had two separate teams:\n✔ Development Team – Senior experts focused on new projects.\n✔ Support Team – Junior engineers handling production issues, often lacking system knowledge.\n\n🚧 The Issues:\n💡 Production support was weak, causing customer frustration.\n💡 Support teams depended on developers, but developers weren’t accountable for production.\n💡 BU leaders had their own priorities—some focused on CEO-driven initiatives, others on production stability, and others on their business unit projects.\n\nWith 130+ engineers spread across 10-12 teams, misalignment was inevitable.\n\nStep 2: Merging Development & Support Teams\nTo fix this, I took a bold step:\n\n✅ Merged Development & Support into one unit under a single Tech Lead per team.\n✅ Now, the right expertise was allocated where needed—whether for fixing production issues or delivering new features.\n✅ This improved accountability and skill alignment, reducing dependency on developers for urgent fixes.\n\n🚀 Result: Production stability improved, but new development timelines were impacted.\n\nStep 3: The Bigger Challenge – Customer Priorities & Billing Issues\nThe customer contract followed \"named resource billing\", meaning:\n\n✔ Each engineer was assigned to a specific workstream and billed accordingly.\n✔ BU leaders had invoice approval authority and focused only on their projects.\n✔ Support engineers were billed monthly, but development engineers were billed per project.\n\n🚧 The problem?\n💡 If a development engineer helped in support, their work wasn’t billable.\n💡 If a support engineer assisted in development, the invoice could be rejected.\n💡 BU leaders rejected billing if engineers worked outside their assigned scope, creating constant conflicts.\n\nNow, the real challenge was aligning leaders, billing structure, and priorities to make this model work.\n\n💡 Have you ever faced a situation where resource allocation and priorities conflicted with customer expectations?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 14: Turning Performance Challenges into a Competitive Advantage\n\nDuring the process automation engagement, our team consisted of 20+ members, including both senior and junior engineers, alongside customer developers working with us.\n\nOne day, the customer program manager pointed out an issue:\n\n📌 Only a few people were delivering strong output.\n📌 Some customer team developers were performing better than our own team.\n📌 The team’s productivity was uneven—why, and how do we fix it?\n\nSince we were chasing an aggressive goal of automating 240 processes in a short time, we needed a solution fast.\n\nGamifying the Challenge – A Cricket-Inspired Dashboard\n\nMy counterpart in the customer team was a big cricket fan. He suggested:\n\n💡 “Why don’t we create a dashboard like a cricket scoreboard—showing our current run rate and the required run rate to win?”\n\nIt made complete sense!\n✔ We had a fixed end date.\n✔ We had a clear target (240 processes).\n✔ We could track progress like a match run rate.\n\n🚀 The Idea:\nWe built a real-time dashboard showing:\n✔ Current vs. required automation rate\n✔ Individual performance scorecards\n✔ Pipeline visibility—who’s contributing to each stage\n\nSince automation required multiple steps—Business Requirements → Tech Implementation → UAT → Go Live—this dashboard tracked every stage transparently.\n\n📊 For the customer team, it showed broad progress.\n📊 For the tech team, it provided detailed insights & accountability.\n\nThe Power of Transparency & Healthy Competition\n\n🚀 The Impact:\n✔ Developers started competing to top the leaderboard.\n✔ Pipeline blockages became visible instantly.\n✔ Everyone felt accountable for hitting the overall goal.\n\n💡 The result? We achieved the milestone ahead of schedule!\n\n🎯 The MD was thrilled, and this project turned into a reference success story for the company.\n\nKey Takeaways from This Experience\n\n💡 1. Strong customer partnership & transparency can turn around failing projects.\n💡 2. Gamifying goals can boost team motivation & performance.\n💡 3. Visibility & accountability drive execution—when teams see the goal, they step up.\n\n🚀 What do you think? Have you ever worked on a project where competition or gamification improved results?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 15: When Tough Decisions Had to Be Made\n\nThis story is from an enterprise account where we were managing the entire suite of applications, handling both development and support.\n\nI was heading technology for the account, leading a team of 130+ people, split across application development and support.\n\n🚀 The First Month – Observing & Analyzing\nAs I took over, I spent a month analyzing:\n✔ How things were working.\n✔ Team alignment & ownership.\n✔ Understanding the complete system architecture.\n\n💡 Everything seemed like BAU—until a boardroom meeting with the CEO changed everything.\n\nThe CEO’s Priority List – A Crisis Unfolds\nDuring a status review, we presented 10-15 CEO-driven projects—all were delayed.\n\n🚧 Some were behind by months (3-6 months or more).\n🚧 The CEO was furious.\n🚧 He instructed the finance team to STOP our payments.\n\n💰 The money at stake was huge. My super boss was in panic mode.\n\nHe turned to me and said:\n💬 “Partha, what do you need to fix this?”\n\nThe Structural Issue – Architects & Ownership\nI had already sensed a strange issue in the team structure:\n📌 Development & support reported to me.\n📌 But architects—who play a crucial role—were reporting elsewhere.\n\n💡 I told my super boss:\n\"I need direct access to all architects and complete control over execution.\"\n\n📌 He agreed instantly. I now had the power to fix the problem—but time was ticking, and payments were on hold.\n\nIdentifying the Root Cause – Leadership Misalignment\nI held 1-on-1 meetings with 11 managers and all senior tech leads to assess the ground reality.\n\n🚧 Managers didn’t grasp the urgency of the situation.\n🚧 They weren’t stepping up to fix the delays.\n🚧 Tech Leads knew the systems inside out, but managers were acting as non-technical coordinators.\n\nI went back to my boss and said:\n💬 “Managers aren’t aligned to the urgency. We should elevate Tech Leads and let managers go”\n\nHe simply said:\n💬 “Do what’s needed.”\n\nThe Toughest Decision of My Career\nI called all 11 managers—explained the expectations.\n\n📌 A few aligned to the new approach.\n📌 But 9 out of 11 didn’t, and I had to let them go.\n\n💡 In just one month, at a new company, in a new account, I had to release 9 managers.\n\nAt the time, I strongly believed: First, work for the company, then the team, then yourself.\n\nI thought whatever was good for the company had to be done. I didn’t consider the personal impact on individuals—my focus was on turning the project around.\n\nBut over time, I questioned this philosophy.\n💡 Now, I believe a leader’s first responsibility is to the people.\n✔ First, people.\n✔ Then, the team.\n✔ Then, the company.\n\nBecause when you take care of people, they take care of the company.\n\nBut this mindset can’t rely on just one leader—it has to be ingrained in a company’s DNA.\n\n💡 Do you agree? Should leadership always prioritize people first?👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day15 hashtag#TurnaroundStories hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Leadership hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 13: Turning Around a High-Stakes Automation Project\n\nThough I had decided to go back to a job, I knew my mission to solve traffic problems wasn’t over. I told myself—I’ll return to it when the time is right. Stay tuned for what happens to my first startup later!\n\nFor now, let’s dive into my corporate journey post-entrepreneurship.\n\nSomething interesting happened—for the next 10 years, I found myself repeatedly handling troubled accounts. Every project I joined was already in deep trouble, and my role was to turn it around.\n\nManaging difficult situations, making tough calls, and being direct with leadership became second nature to me.\n\nI’ll share stories from these challenging projects—real situations, real lessons, but without disclosing specifics due to confidentiality.\n\nThe First Turnaround Challenge\n\nI joined a large enterprise account where my boss told me:\n\n📌 The company had committed to automating 400 processes in one year.\n📌 Only 40% were completed in 8 months—leaving 60% (240 processes) to be done in 4 months.\n📌 The project was a personal initiative of the company’s MD—if we failed, the contract was at risk.\n\n🚀 First Day, First Reality Check\n\nMy first customer meeting was intense—two key stakeholders asked:\n\n💬 “What’s going on? What’s the plan?”\n\nI was honest:\n👉 “I need to fully understand the current state first. What’s your assessment of what’s going wrong?”\n\n💡 Lesson #1: Transparency builds trust. Instead of giving a scripted answer, I openly acknowledged the situation. The stakeholder appreciated my approach.\n\n🚀 Digging Deeper: Identifying the Real Issue\n\nAfter meeting senior team members, I uncovered the core problem:\n📌 Lack of business involvement. Teams weren’t getting the required support from business leaders to define automation requirements.\n\n📊 I analyzed 8 months of data and presented it to the customer, proving that:\n👉 Even with the best tech execution, without a strong pipeline of business requirements, we wouldn’t reach the 400-process target.\n\n🚀 Escalating the Issue to the Right Level\n\nI met with the customer’s program manager and suggested escalating to the MD. We needed:\n✔ Clear prioritization from business leaders.\n✔ Top-down alignment on automation goals.\n\nThe MD stepped in, and within weeks, all business leaders aligned their priorities to the project.\n\n💡 Lesson #2: Strategic projects need top-down alignment. When priorities aren’t clear, execution suffers.\n\n💡 Lesson #3: You can’t sugarcoat problems in a crisis. When things are in trouble, be upfront with the highest decision-makers—they’re responsible for success.\n\nSee You Tomorrow for Another Story!\n\nWould love to hear—have you ever faced a situation where priorities weren’t aligned, and it stalled progress?

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 11: Cracking the Ride Request Search Algorithm – Finding Requests for a Ride\n\nAfter solving how to find a ride for a ride request, I realized that finding ride requests for a planned ride was a much harder problem.\n\nI started researching existing solutions and dived deep into algorithms and research papers to figure out:\n\n🚀 How do we efficiently find points (pickup/drop locations) along a route?\n\nStep 1: Researching Spatial Algorithms\nI read multiple research papers and algorithms related to spherical geometry and spatial search, including:\n\n📖 Primitive operations in computational geometry\n📖 Convex hull & Voronoi diagrams\n📖 Shortest path algorithms for taxis\n📖 Fast route planning algorithms\n\n💡 It was overwhelming!\nThere was a ton of information, but I stayed focused on one goal:\n✔ How to find relevant points along a given route?\n\nAnything unrelated, I discarded—I didn’t need a PhD in computational geometry, just a practical solution!\n\nStep 2: The Polygon Approach – First Breakthrough\nInitially, I thought:\n💡 If I could create a large polygon covering the entire route, I could find all ride requests within it.\n\nSo I tried:\n✔ Creating a bounding box (polygon) around the entire route.\n✔ Querying all ride requests within this polygon.\n✔ Filtering requests that had the shortest pickup distance to the route.\n\n🚧 Issue: If the ride route is 20-30 km long, the polygon would be too large, covering almost the entire city of Bangalore.\n💡 This would return too many results, making the search inefficient.\n\nBack to square one. I needed a better approach.\n\nStep 3: Route Boxer – The Game-Changer\nThen I came across a concept called \"Route Boxer\" in one of the research papers.\n\n🚀 Breakthrough Idea:\n✔ Instead of creating one large polygon, create multiple small rectangles along the route.\n✔ Each rectangle covers a small section of the route.\n✔ The width of the rectangles aligns with the maximum pickup distance a ride requestor is willing to travel.\n\n💡 Why was this better?\n✅ Instead of one huge search area, I now had multiple small search areas.\n✅ Each rectangle could be queried independently, improving accuracy.\n✅ The search only returned relevant ride requests near the route.\n\n🚀 Now, the search process became simple:\n1️⃣ Create small rectangles along the entire route.\n2️⃣ Query all ride requests within those rectangles.\n3️⃣ Match pickup and drop points based on time and availability.\n\n🚀 Hooray! I had cracked the ride request search algorithm.\n\nStep 4: The Road to Implementation\nWith ride search and request matching solved, I had:\n✔ The design\n✔ The core algorithm (No code)\n✔ The technology decisions\n\nBut this wasn’t an overnight success—it took me exactly one month to complete (from 30th Sep to 29th Oct 2015).\n\n💡 Next: The Journey of Coding Begins— Day 12.\n\nHow Important is Design and Core Algorithm Before Writing the First Line of Code?👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day11 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 9: The Evolution of Ride Matching – Handling GPS Precision & Spherical Geometry\n\nIn Day 8, I talked about how I initially approached ride matching using simple geometry, assuming that roads were straight lines. But I quickly realized:\n\n🚧 Roads aren’t straight.\n🚧 GPS locations are precise.\n🚧 The Earth isn’t flat.\n\nEach of these brought new challenges, and I had to rethink my entire approach.\n\nStep 3: The Lat/Lon Precision Problem – Why Exact Points Wouldn’t Match\n\nEven if a pickup or drop point is theoretically on the same route, its latitude and longitude values won’t match exactly.\n\n🚧 Issue:\n\nEven if a point is just 1 meter away from the ride path, its lat, long values will be slightly different.\nSince our logic was based on mathematical equations, a tiny variation in coordinates could cause a mismatch—even if the user was on the same road.\n💡 Solution: Expand the Search Area\n1️⃣ Instead of checking for an exact match, I created a 100m zone around each ride segment.\n2️⃣ For each location, I calculated four new points—100 meters to the North, East, West, and South.\n3️⃣ Using these, I formed a polygon around the route.\n4️⃣ Now, instead of checking if a point is on the exact ride, I checked if the ride passes through this polygon.\n\n🚀 This handled minor GPS variations, improving match accuracy.\n\nBut I still had one more problem…\n\nStep 4: The Earth Isn’t Flat – Entering Spherical Geometry\n\nUntil now, I treated the world like a flat map, using X and Y coordinates as if I was plotting points on a piece of paper.\n\n🚧 Issue: A straight line on a flat map doesn’t accurately represent a real-world path on a spherical planet.\n\n💡 I needed to learn spherical geometry.\nI started studying:\n✔ How latitude and longitude work in relation to Earth’s curvature.\n✔ What \"degrees\" mean in terms of real-world distances.\n✔ How to calculate points at a specific distance and direction on a sphere.\n\nAt this point, my simple straight-line approach was no longer enough.\n\nStep 5: How to Represent All Rides in the System?\n\n🚧 Issue: Searching every ride one by one wasn’t scalable.\n\n💡 New Approach: Represent Rides as a Global Network\nInstead of treating rides as separate routes, I structured them into a network of ride segments:\n\n1️⃣ Each ride is a collection of GPS points (nodes).\n2️⃣ Each segment between two points is an edge.\n3️⃣ Each edge stores ride details like ride ID, time, direction, and speed.\n4️⃣ Vertices (junctions) link multiple rides together.\n\n🚀 Now, instead of searching every ride one by one, I could query a structured network.\n\nThis meant:\n✅ Finding ride matches faster.\n✅ Handling millions of rides efficiently.\n✅ Filtering rides based on real-world conditions.\n\nI still had to crack the ride search algo, that's for tomorrow.\n\nHave You Ever Faced Unexpected Complexity While Solving a Simple Problem?\nWould love to hear your thoughts! 👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day9 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

It returned:\n✔ GPS points (Lat, Lng, Time) between the start and end location.\n✔ Turn-by-turn details of the journey.\n\nNow, where to store this data?\n\n💡 MongoDB’s spherical indexing was a breakthrough!\n✔ Stores points as (Lat, Lng) coordinates.\n✔ Supports searching for nearby points within a radius.\n✔ Allows filtering based on time and availability.\n\n🚀 This eliminated the need for graph traversal!\n\nStep 3: The Ride Search Algorithm\n\nWith MongoDB, ride search became simple:\n\n/*\n * Ride Search Logic:\n * \n * - Get all rides near pickup location (with radius of lets say 100m)\n * - Get all rides near drop location (with radius of lets say 100m)\n * - Keep only rides present in both pickup & drop points\n * - Ensure pickup comes before drop (check ride direction)\n * - Remove unavailable rides\n * - Remaining rides are valid matches\n */\n\n🚀 Hooray! I had cracked ride search.\n\nI felt on top of the world, celebrating this breakthrough.\n\nStep 4: Why Finding Ride Requests for a Ride is Harder\n\nAt this stage, my algorithm worked well for finding rides for a ride request.\n🚧 Issue: What if I wanted to do the reverse?\n💡 How do we find all matching ride requests for a ride that’s already planned?\n📍 In my current approach, the pickup zone method wouldn’t work—because a ride consists of a collection of points forming a route.\n📍 Instead of finding just one pickup and drop match, I needed to check all ride requests that could be fulfilled along the route.\n📍 This turned out to be a much harder problem than just searching for a ride request.\n🚀 That’s why finding an available cab near your location (like Uber) is easy, but cab-sharing is a much harder problem!\n\n💡 Next, I had to rethink my approach to handling ride requests dynamically.\n\nThat’s what I tackled in Day 11.\n\nHave You Ever Solved a Problem, Only to Find a Bigger One?\nWould love to hear your experiences! 👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day10 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 8: The Evolution of Ride Matching – From Basic Geometry to Real-World Roads\n\nDefining the Problem: What Is a Ride and a Ride Request?\nBefore solving the problem, I needed to define two key concepts:\n\n✔ Ride – A car owner traveling from start point A to end point B following a specific route.\n✔ Ride Request – Someone looking for a ride from pickup point P to drop point D.\n\n🚀 The real challenge: When someone requests a ride, how do we determine if their pickup (P) and drop (D) points lie on the route that a car owner would take from A to B?\n\nThis seemed like a simple matching problem at first. If P and D fall on the same route as A to B, the ride request should be matched to the ride.\n\nBut reality? 🚧 Not that simple.\n\nStep 1: Using a Basic Line Equation\nMy initial approach was based on simple geometry:\n💡 If a ride follows a path from A to B, and we know the equation of this path, we can check if P and D fall on the same line.\n\nHere’s how I structured the logic:\n\n1️⃣ First, draw a line between the start and end points of a ride (A to B) based on latitude and longitude (lat, long).\n2️⃣ Define an X and Y axis, where the X-axis passes through the center of the Earth horizontally, meeting Greenwich.\n3️⃣ Convert lat, long of all points into degrees so they can be plotted on the coordinate system.\n4️⃣ Now, plot the points on the X-Y axis defined in step 2.\n5️⃣ Using these two points, find the equation of the line (first calculating the slope and then forming the equation)\n6️⃣ Once the equation is determined, check if the pickup & drop points (P & D) exist on this line.\n\n🚀 This seemed like a logical solution!\n\n✅ The assumption: If a ride is represented by a line, and we can confirm that P and D exist on this line, the ride request matches the ride.\n\n🚧 But as I tested this logic, I realized it wasn’t that simple…\n\nStep 2: The Zig-Zag Challenge – Roads Are Not Straight\n🚧 Issue: Roads aren’t straight like mathematical lines.\n\nA ride isn’t a single straight path but a series of connected segments.\nThe route consists of turns, intersections, and multiple waypoints.\n💡 New Thought: Instead of treating a ride as one long line, I needed to break it into smaller segments.\n\n1️⃣ Each ride consists of multiple short straight-line segments connecting GPS points.\n2️⃣ To determine whether the pickup and drop points of a ride request match an existing ride, I had to check whether they appeared along any of these smaller segments.\n\n🚀 This seemed promising, but another issue came up.\n\nAt this stage, I thought I had cracked the problem. Break the ride into smaller parts, and the issue is solved.\n\nBut real-world GPS data created a new set of challenges, which I’ll cover tomorrow. \n\nHave You Ever Started with a Simple Idea That Became a Complex Engineering Problem?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences in the comments! 👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day8 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 7: From Learning to Building – The Start of Product Development\n\nWith the core foundation in place, it was time for product development.\n\nSince this was a high-volume system, I knew scalability had to be a key focus from Day 1.\n\nSo, I followed a structured approach:\n\n1️⃣ Requirement Documentation\n2️⃣ Design (UML – Class Diagram & ERD – Database Design)\n3️⃣ Coding\n\nThis wasn’t just another CRUD-based application—it involved complex design decisions that had to be done right from the start.\n\nInstead of worrying about design issues and ride-matching complexities, I decided to take it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Documenting the Requirements\nI documented product requirements, focusing on features and system behavior without worrying about feasibility.\n\n🔹 Clarity increased as I documented features.\n🔹 Key system challenges became visible.\n🔹 Design decisions became more structured.\n\nThis process took just 2 days, but the impact was huge.\n\nStep 2: Designing the System\nClass Diagram – Building the Domain Model\nI created a class diagram, focusing on entity relationships to visualize the architecture.\n\nDatabase Design – The Core of the System\nAt NCST, I had worked on a Railway Reservation System as a project. My partner, Parwez Mohammad, was my biggest support system.\n\n🔹 He grasped new languages fast, then taught me.\n🔹 We worked in sync—he coded first while I shadowed, then he handed over coding to me.\n\n💡 This was pair programming, a technique I later discovered was a big part of Thoughtworks development approach.\n\n🔹 NCST forced us to deliver every project in groups, making collaboration key.\n\nOne core learning from NCST:\n\n⚡ If ERD is perfect, coding is easy. If ERD is messy, handling every scenario becomes complex.\n\nSo, I spent a lot of time ensuring my ERD was solid, as my system would handle billions of ride data points.\n\nStep 3: Choosing the Right Tech Stack\nI took a minimalistic approach, selecting only essential technologies to keep the learning curve small.\n\nOne of the biggest decisions was where to store ride data.\n\nA ride in my system is a collection of GPS points at 5-50 meter intervals.\n\nFor example, a 10 km ride would generate ~200 data points.\n\n🔹 If my system had 1M rides/day, it would store 1B+ points in just 5 days!\n\nTo handle this:\n✔ Relational DB for structured data.\n✔ Horizontally scalable NoSQL DB for ride points.\n✔ Geospatial Indexing for efficient ride matching.\n\nAfter evaluating multiple databases, I chose MongoDB (cloud version) for its:\n✔ Horizontal scaling support\n✔ Built-in spherical indexing for location-based searches\n\nNext Up: Cracking the Core Logic – Ride Matching Algorithm\nWith design decisions locked, it was time to tackle the real challenge—\n🚀 How to match ride partners?\n\nHave You Ever Built a Scalable System from Scratch?\nWould love to hear your thoughts on designing for scale and handling large datasets!\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day7 hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories - Day 6: Relearning to Code – Starting from Scratch\n\nI had made up my mind—\n🚫 No more hunting for a CTO.\n🚫 No more hiring freshers.\n🚫 No more job hunting.\n👉 I would develop my product myself.\n\nAssessing My Skills & What Was Needed -\n\nI started listing down what I already knew:\n✔ Java\n✔ SQL\n✔ Web & Application Servers\n\nI had always worked on backend development and middleware infrastructure management. But now, I needed to build an entire product from scratch.\n\nI broke down the tech stack required:\n1️⃣ Backend – Java, Spring Framework, Hibernate (ORM), DB, REST API\n2️⃣ Data Structures & Algorithms – Critical for my system as matching rides is all about algo and DS\n3️⃣ Design – UML, ERD\n4️⃣ Frontend – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery\n\nI realized—I had left coding in 2010, and in five years, technology had evolved massively. Even what I knew had changed.\n\nI had to start fresh as a programmer.\n\nThe Fastest Way to Learn? Online Courses.\n\nTo learn fast, I turned to online courses.\n\nThat’s when I discovered Koushik Kothagal, founder of Javabrains. His free courses covered exactly what I needed—fundamentals of modern Java and backend development.\n\nSo, on August 12, 2015, I started relearning everything from scratch.\n\nMy top focus area was Data Structures & Algorithms, so I picked up \"Introduction to Algorithms\" (CLRS)—the bible of algorithms.\nI wanted to master:\n✔ Core algorithms\n✔ Advanced data structures (Graphs & Binary Trees)\nI also watched MIT OpenCourseWare lectures to strengthen my concepts.\n\n6 Weeks of Grinding – Back to Coding -\n\nFor the next six weeks, I was fully immersed in coding.\n\nBy September 29, I had:\n✅ Completed multiple courses\n✅ Practiced core programming concepts\n✅ Rebuilt confidence in writing production-grade code\n\nI still remember struggling with my first \"Hello World\" program—\nI had written the function outside main() and spent hours debugging it! 😅\n\nBut I had one advantage—\nAt NCST, we learned 10-12 programming languages in 12 months and built 10+ projects. I knew once I got into the flow, I could learn at rocket speed.\n\nFrom Salary Worries to Pure Joy -\n\nBy the time three months had passed without a salary, something changed.\n💡 My focus shifted from money to happiness—because now, I had all the skills to build my product myself.\n\nThis journey taught me—\n🛠 Every skill we acquire will be useful someday—we just don’t know when.\n\nI tracked my learning in my project management tool, helping me recall specific dates even 10 years later.\n\nNext Up: My Approach to Product Development\n\nNow that I had all the tools, how did I start building the actual product? That’s tomorrow’s story.\n\nHave You Ever Had to Relearn Something You Left Long Ago?\n\nHave you ever refreshed an old skill because of the need of the hour?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences in the comments! 👇\n\n🚀 Follow my 365-day journey—one story every day.\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Day6 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea hashtag#NCST",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 1: The Moment I Knew I Had to Leave IBM\n\n\n\nToday marks the start of my 365-day challenge—one personal story every single day.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because I’m building my personal brand.\n\n\n\nI’ve launched my new baby—ElevateIdea around a year back, a company helping growth-stage startups remove technology barriers to scale and grow. But there’s a challenge—I am not a sales guy.\n\n\n\nIn B2B, no one buys without trust and credibility. Founders don’t just buy services; they buy into the people behind them. I believe the best way to build trust is to be authentic, share my journey, and let people see who I am.\n\nSo, here we go. 365 days. 365 stories. Let’s see where this takes us.\n\n\n\nDay 1: The Moment I Knew I Had to Leave IBM\n\n\n\nI grew up in a middle-class family—my father was a Mechanical Engineer working in the steel industry, while my mother came from a business family. Like many in the 90s, I believed the service-class life was the ultimate goal—clear IIT/REC, land a great job, and life is set! \n\n\n\nBut this is not another story of an IIT guy—I was a very normal guy and ended up at TKIET, a regular private college in Maharashtra.\n\n\n\nFor the longest time, I thought I was winning. By 2008, I was at IBM, traveling the world, staying in 5-star hotels, and working on high-impact projects. Life looked great… until I read \"Rich Dad Poor Dad.\"\n\n\n\nThat book flipped my perspective. It hit me—my father was the 'Poor Dad' character from the book. Like him, I was on a linear path, working hard but paying 50-60% of my income in taxes. Meanwhile, businesses had the advantage—paying only 20% tax on profits and leveraging systems to scale.\n\n\n\nThis realization changed everything.\n\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2015, while still at IBM, I brainstormed startup ideas—BigBasket, Delivery from local stores for groceries (BlinkIt of now), and many more. But I never took the leap. I saw ideas I once dismissed turn into billion-dollar companies, and the regret grew.\n\n\n\nAt IBM, my career moved from leading Business Development for one of IBM’s products at the India level, which gave me direct access to CXOs, to working on a $1B account, where I interacted with senior leaders just 3-4 layers below the CEO.\n\n\n\nYet, I felt zero excitement. The game was about navigating corporate politics, not solving real challenges.\n\n\n\nThat wasn’t me. I was wired for action, not for maneuvering hierarchies.\n\n\n\nOne fine day in April 2015, I decided enough was enough. No Plan B. No safety net. I just quit.\n\n\n\nI still remember my first day at IBM induction, looking at the roadmap to becoming a Distinguished Engineer or Fellow. I once dreamed of that title, but in the end, I chose my own path—the unpredictable, challenging, and thrilling world of entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\nIt was a bold move. Was it worth it? Well… that’s a story for tomorrow.\n\n\n\nFollow this journey as I share one story every day for 365 days.\n\n\n\nWould love to hear your bold move.\n\n\n\n#365DaysOfStories #Entrepreneurship #BuildingInPublic #PersonalBrand #GrowthMindset #ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 2: How I Decided to Solve Traffic Congestion\n\nWhen I resigned in April 2015 to venture into entrepreneurship, I had no idea what business I was going to start. But one thing was clear—I did not want to do a job anymore.\n\nThat, in itself, was a big discovery.\n\nSometimes, in life, we may not know what we want, but if we know what we don’t want, that’s enough to take the first step. Eliminate what’s not meant for you, and the right path will reveal itself.\n\nDuring my 3-month notice period, I explored all kinds of business ideas—not just software but everything from:\n✅ Kids’ daycare\n✅ Interior decoration\n✅ Software services\n\nMy thought process was simple:\n🔹 Find a business that makes money\n🔹 Choose something which I can do\n\nOne of the most tempting ideas was interior decoration.\n\nA carpenter in my society, Aneesh, had transformed himself from being a factory worker to running a ₹5 Cr+ annual revenue business, handling interiors for over 100 apartments. With 20-40% profit margins, I thought, this is a goldmine!\n\nBut when I shared this idea with my wife and mother, they were completely against it.\n\nTheir logic?\n🔸 Aneesh was a carpenter himself—he couldn’t be fooled by laborers, whereas I had no expertise in carpentry.\n🔸 He hired workers from his village who lived with him, creating trust and loyalty—something I couldn’t replicate.\n\nSimilarly, they dismissed my daycare idea with a simple truth:\n“You can’t even take care of your own kids properly (which we manage). How will you take care of 50 other kids?”\n\nTheir point was clear—whatever business I choose, I need to know it inside out.\n\nSo, I decided to stick to software, since that’s what I knew best.\n\nI started analyzing daily life challenges of middle class.\n\nI looked at everything middle-class working professionals deal with:\n🛒 Grocery shopping – already solved\n🚖 Daily commuting – Hmm…\n👶 Childcare & tuition – already solved\n\nThen it hit me:\n💡 We waste 2-3 hours every day in traffic just commuting to work!\n\n🚦 Traffic is a huge problem—not just in Bangalore, but globally\n\nI asked myself:\n👉 Can this be solved with software?\n✅ Yes!\n\nBreaking Down the Problem\n\n🔹 Why is there so much traffic?\n👉 Because too many cars are on the road.\n🔹 How much space do they take up?\n👉 80% of the road is occupied by cars, while only 20% is used by buses and two-wheelers.\n🔹 How can we reduce the number of cars?\n👉 Carpooling!\n\nSimple, right? But then, I asked the real question:\n\n🤔 Why don’t people carpool?\n1️⃣ Trust issues – People don’t feel safe sharing rides with strangers.\n2️⃣ Inconvenience – No seamless way to coordinate carpools.\n3️⃣ Privacy concerns – People like the comfort of their personal space.\n\nBut could these problems be solved?\n\n✅ Yes!\n\nSo I made up my mind—I would solve traffic congestion.\n\nWhat happened next? Stay tuned!\n\nHave you ever taken a leap into the unknown without a clear plan?\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 3: Cracking the Code for Carpooling\n\nWith my business idea finalized during my notice period—solving traffic congestion—the next challenge was:\n\n💡 How do we solve it?\n\nThe three biggest barriers stopping people from carpooling were:\n1️⃣ Trust – People don’t feel safe sharing rides with strangers.\n2️⃣ Convenience – Finding a ride should be as easy as booking Uber/Ola\n3️⃣ Privacy – Why would car owners share their personal space with others?\n\n1. Solving the Trust Issue\n\nThe first and biggest challenge was trust.\n\nI asked myself: Why do we trust someone?\n👉 Because we either know them personally or they come recommended by someone we trust.\n\nThat’s when it hit me—what if we created a “Trust Network” for carpooling?\n\n✅ Users could add their trusted people into groups.\n✅ Rides would be matched only within their trust circle or extended network (2nd-degree connections, like LinkedIn).\n\nThis way, you wouldn’t be sharing a ride with a random stranger—you’d only connect with people trusted by someone you trust.\n\nTrust? ✅ Solved.\n\n2. Solving the Convenience Issue\n\nThis was easy.\n\nUber and Ola had already cracked real-time ride matching using live location tracking. We could apply the same approach to carpooling—rides should be available in minutes.\n\nConvenience? ✅ Solved.\n\n3. Solving the Privacy Issue – The Big Aha Moment\n\nThis was the hardest part.\n\nWhy would a car owner share a ride? Most carpooling platforms assumed the answer was money—saving fuel costs. But was that really enough?\n\nI dug deeper into the psychology of car owners:\n🚗 They earn ₹1L+ per month and own a ₹5-15L car—not just for transport, but as a lifestyle choice.\n💰 Saving ₹2-4K on fuel isn’t a big enough incentive for them.\n❌ They won’t compromise their privacy just to save a little money.\n\nThen I flipped the question: What would make me, as a car owner, willingly share my ride?\n\nI asked myself, Who would I genuinely enjoy sharing a ride with?\n\n💡 If I could share my daily commute with new entrepreneurs, successful founders, investors, or mentors, I wouldn’t just be willing to give them a ride—I’d go out of my way to drop them off AND even pay for this opportunity!\n\nThis made me realize:\n\n✔️ For different people, at different stages of life, their interests vary.\n✔️ The key was to match riders based on shared interests, so they would actually enjoy the time spent in traffic.\n✔️ Traffic wouldn’t feel like wasted time anymore—it would become an opportunity for meaningful conversations.\n\nThat was the missing piece—the biggest USP of my idea:\n\n✅ Make carpooling about valuable connections, not money.\n\nPrivacy concern? ✅ Solved.\n\nWhat next!!! Will share tomorrow.\n\nWhat’s Your “Eureka” Moment?\n\nHave you ever analyzed a problem and had a sudden breakthrough—something so clear and game-changing that you felt like jumping in excitement?\n\nWould love to hear your stories in the comments! 👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 4: The Shift from Tech to Business & The Search for a CTO\n\nBy this point, I had my problem statement and solution figured out—solving traffic congestion through a trust-based carpooling system. Now, the next big challenge was:\n\n💡 How do I build the technology?\n\nThe Price of Moving Away from Tech\n\nUntil 2010, I was an extraordinary software engineer. But after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad in 2008, I became obsessed with the idea that I needed to either start a business or become a CEO.\n\nBack then, my understanding was simple: Only management guys become CEOs, not tech people.\n\nBetween 2007-2010, I was traveling extensively for work—London, Amsterdam, Norway—working on global projects and experiencing different cultures.\n\nBut the more I thought about the future, the more I realized—I wanted to be on the business side of things.\n\nWhen I returned to India in 2010, I told my manager:\n\n🗣️ “I want to move into management. I want to be a CEO someday, and I don’t see how a technical guy can reach that level.”\n\nHe connected me to his skip-line boss, who gave me advice I’ll never forget:\n\n💡 “There’s huge competition for every management role, but in technology, you may not become a CEO, but there are enough seats for great tech minds at least till IBM Distinguished Engineer—which is equally senior.”\n\nBut I wasn’t convinced. I said, “I want to be a CEO, please help me move into management.”\n\nSince I was a top performer, he somehow managed a business development role for me.\n\nLooking back, I wonder why he helped me?\n\nMaybe he saw that I was a different kind of guy—someone bold enough to say this early in my career.\n\nBecause the role he gave me in sales was not easy—it was a high-pressure, sink-or-swim role. Maybe he thought, Let him prove himself here!\n\nFor the next five years, I was completely out of tech.\n\nBut now, in 2015, when it came to implementing my startup idea, I felt helpless.\n\nTech had moved so fast that I felt handicapped.\n\nThe Hunt for a Cofounder & CTO\n\nI started looking for a Cofounder & CTO to implement my idea.\n\nMeanwhile, my last salary was credited in June, and by July, the reality hit—\n⏳ Time was ticking.\n💰 I had only 10 months of savings.\n🏡 I had promised my family that no one’s lifestyle would change—even if I had to sell my flat.\n\nI called up all my friends—people in well-settled careers, earning good money, with home loans and kids.\n\nReality check:\n❌ No one was crazy enough to leave their job to join me.\n❌ I needed a full-time Cofounder & CTO.\n❌ But I didn’t have money to hire a senior guy.\n\nAfter multiple rejections, I decided—\n👉 Let’s hire freshers and build the product under my guidance.\n\nHow? Stay tuned \n\nHave You Ever Had to Pivot?\n\nHave you ever made a big career decision that later made things harder instead of easier? How did you deal with it?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences in the comments! 👇\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

    "content": "365 Days of Stories – Day 5: The “Company” That Didn’t Exist\n\nBy now, I had accepted that finding a Cofounder & CTO was going to be difficult. No one from my network was ready to leave their stable, well-paying job to join me full-time.\n\nSo, I pivoted.\n👉 Let’s hire freshers and build the product under my guidance.\n\nBut what happened next was something I never expected.\n\nThe Plan: Hiring Freshers from NCST\n\nI decided to go to NCST, where I did my post-graduate course.\n\n📌 NCST (National Centre for Software Technology) offered an extremely difficult course called FPGDST.\n📌 The total intake was 160 students, but only 50% remained after 6 months due to the difficulty level.\n📌 By the end, only 5-10% graduated.\n📌 Even those who didn’t complete the course ended up in great careers—that’s how intense it was.\n\nI thought, this is the best place to find solid freshers.\n\nI met the Head of Placements, hoping to get access to students.\n\nThen this conversation happened:\n\n🔹 “What’s your company name?”\n👉 “I haven’t decided yet.”\n\n🔹 “Is it registered?”\n👉 “No.”\n\n🔹 “How many people in your company?”\n👉 “Just me.”\n\n🔹 “Is it funded?”\n👉 “No.”\n\nThen he said something that shattered my confidence:\n\n“So, what do I tell my students? That an entrepreneur with no company, no funding, and no team wants to hire them?”\n\n💔 That was brutal.\n\nHe refused to let me talk to the students. One month had already passed without a salary.\n\nReality Was Hitting Hard\n\nBy now, August had started.\n\n📉 No Cofounder.\n📉 No CTO.\n📉 No team.\n📉 No product development started.\n\nMy family started suggesting I go back to a job.\n\nI considered freelancing, but then I asked myself:\n“What can I even sell?”\n\n🤷‍♂️ I was a management guy—I had spent 5 years leading teams, not writing code.\n🤷‍♂️ Without a company, I had no team to manage.\n🤷‍♂️ I couldn’t even earn ₹1 from freelancing because I had no technical skills left.\n\nThis was highly frustrating.\n\nI decided—even if I go back to a job, I will return to tech.\n\nA Moment of Frustration & Realization\n\nI applied for technical jobs, and one interviewer asked me:\n“How do you compare two strings?”\n\nAt that moment, it hit me—\n\n📉 “What nonsense am I doing? I left a senior role to solve a global problem, and here I am, being tested on string comparison.”\n\nThis was absurd.\n\n💡 Right then, I made a bold decision—\n\n🚀 Forget hiring a team. Forget finding a Cofounder & CTO. I’ll build the product myself.\n\nNext: Relearning Tech from Scratch\n\nWith zero coding practice for 5 years, I had to relearn everything from scratch.\n\nHow did I do it? That’s the story for tomorrow.\n\nHave You Ever Felt Stuck?\n\nHave you ever been in a situation where you felt completely stuck and had to restart from zero?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences in the comments! 👇\n\n🚀 Follow my 365-day journey—one story every day.\n\nhashtag#Day5 hashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#StartupJourney hashtag#PersonalBrand hashtag#ElevateIdea",

Not my skillset.\n\nYet, in just 18 days, I built a complete SaaS platform UI prototype and redesigned our corporate website — work that would normally take 3–6 months with a dedicated frontend team.\n\nAnd here's the reality:\nI didn't write a single line of code.\n\n💻 What We Achieved in 18 Days\n\n📱 SaaS Platform Prototype\n▪️ Lead management, invoicing, CRM, production tracking\n▪️ Mobile-first responsive design\n▪️ Multilingual support (Gujarati, Hindi, English)\n▪️ Enterprise-grade UI/UX\n\n🌐 Corporate Website\n▪️ SEO-optimized and mobile responsive\n▪️ Business storytelling, founder journey, turnaround stories\n▪️ Customer-ready lead generation forms\n\n👉 Experience it yourself here: www.elevateidea.com\n\n🤝 How It Happened\n\nI provided the business vision.\nClaude Code, my AI companion, turned it into thousands of lines of clean React/TypeScript/CSS.\n\nThis wasn't about replacing developers.\nIt was about bridging my skill gap — empowering me to build something I couldn't have built alone.\n\n🌟 The Takeaway\n\nThe future of development isn't human vs AI.\nIt's human + AI.\n\nThat's how we achieve 10X speed.\nThat's how non-designers and non-frontend experts can still deliver enterprise-grade products.\n\nThank you, Claude, for being more than a tool — for being a true companion in this journey.\n\nhashtag#365DaysOfStories hashtag#AI hashtag#Claude hashtag#Innovation hashtag#MSME hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment",
