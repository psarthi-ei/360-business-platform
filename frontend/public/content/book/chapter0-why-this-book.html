      <h2>Why I Am Writing This Book</h2>

      <p>
        I am writing this book because I believe we have reached the end of a long chapter
        in the history of software development — and the beginning of another for which
        we do not yet have a playbook.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started my career in software around <strong>2003</strong>. Over the next
        <strong>twenty years (2003–2023)</strong>, I experienced almost every major shift
        in how software is built and how engineering organizations operate.
      </p>

      <p>I have worked in a world where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Software was delivered using <strong>pure waterfall</strong>, with large, centralized teams</li>
        <li>Infrastructure meant <strong>physical data centers</strong>, servers, operating systems, and installations from CDs</li>
        <li>Databases, middleware, and networks were manually provisioned and tightly controlled</li>
        <li>Releases were rare, expensive, and risky</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I then lived through the industry’s gradual — and often painful — transformation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From <strong>waterfall to agile</strong></li>
        <li>From <strong>monoliths to microservices</strong></li>
        <li>From <strong>on-premise infrastructure to cloud</strong></li>
        <li>From long-lived programs to continuous delivery</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I did not experience these changes from a single vantage point. Over these two
        decades, I worked across <strong>large enterprises, mid-sized companies, and startups</strong>.
        I played multiple roles — engineer, engineering leader, and founder.
      </p>

      <p>
        I did not follow a single, linear corporate path. Because of that, I saw more of
        the system than most people do.
      </p>

      <h2>What Failure Taught Me</h2>

      <p>
        Most importantly, I have seen <strong>failure</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not just failed applications, but failed <strong>programs</strong>, failed
        <strong>engineering teams</strong>, and failed <strong>engineering organizations</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have seen projects collapse under their own complexity.
        I have seen teams burn out while “doing everything right.”
        I have seen organizations confuse activity with progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was also fortunate enough to be part of multiple <strong>turnarounds</strong> —
        situations where systems were stabilized, teams were realigned, and delivery was restored.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Engineering success or failure is rarely about tools or talent.<br />
        It is about <strong>how work is structured and how decisions are made</strong>.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        For a long time, the industry believed Agile was the final answer to this problem.
        And for a while, it helped.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, even organizations that claim to be Agile often are not.
        The practices exist, but the <strong>way of thinking has stalled</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Break That Changes Everything</h2>

      <p>And then came AI.</p>

      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is not just another tool added to the engineering toolbox.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first time in the history of software development,
        <strong>the activity that consumed most engineering effort — writing code —
        is no longer the primary bottleneck</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Senior engineers increasingly do not write most of their code directly</li>
        <li>AI systems generate, refactor, and reason about code faster than humans can</li>
        <li>The role of the engineer is shifting from <em>author</em> to <em>director</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I have experienced this shift personally. I have built a complete, real product
        largely hands-on, using AI as part of my daily development workflow.
        This was not experimentation — it was production work.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the way we write software has fundamentally changed,
        then the way we <strong>organize, lead, and measure engineering teams must change too</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yet, there is no clear answer to how.
      </p>

      <h2>The Question This Book Is Trying to Answer</h2>

      <blockquote>
        What does a future-ready engineering organization actually look like in an AI-first world?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Not in theory.<br />
        Not in conference talks or vendor presentations.
      </p>

      <p>But in terms of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ways of working</li>
        <li>Roles and responsibilities</li>
        <li>Team structures</li>
        <li>Leadership expectations</li>
        <li>Human judgment versus machine capability</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The assumptions that shaped waterfall, Agile, DevOps, and microservices were all
        built on one underlying truth:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Humans had to write the code.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That truth no longer fully holds.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book exists because I am trying to figure out what replaces it.
      </p>

      <h2>How This Book Is Being Written</h2>

      <p>
        I am not writing this book from a position of certainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am writing it <strong>while learning</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a book written in public, chapter by chapter, with the explicit intent of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Applying judgment formed over two decades</li>
        <li>Questioning old assumptions</li>
        <li>Inviting disagreement and alternative perspectives</li>
        <li>Letting the ideas evolve over time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I do not have all the answers.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I do have is experience, pattern recognition, and a strong belief that
        <strong>engineering organizations must be intentionally redesigned for the AI era</strong>.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Who This Book Is For</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Engineering leaders who have lived through multiple generations of software development</li>
        <li>Senior engineers trying to understand how their role is changing</li>
        <li>CTOs and founders who want to build organizations that can evolve over the next decade</li>
        <li>Teams preparing for a <strong>multi-year transformation</strong>, not a quick adoption phase</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is not a book about AI tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a book about <strong>building future-ready engineering organizations</strong>.
      </p>

      <p><em>This is the beginning.</em></p>
