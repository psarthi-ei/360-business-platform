💭 365 Days of Story: Day 47 — Are You a Job Person or a Business Person?

There’s an easier way to figure out if you’re made for business or for a job.
Not by looking forward — but by looking back.

I’m in my mid-40s now. And when I look at my 20+ year career, the signs were always there — I had just never looked at them so thoughtfully before.

Here are a few powerful traits that helped me reflect:

1️⃣ Do you always say yes to your boss?
🙅‍♂️ If your answer is no — dig deeper.
💬 Do you challenge decisions? Push your point? Refuse to blindly accept things just because someone senior said so?
This independent thinking is a strong entrepreneurial trait.

2️⃣ Are you uncomfortable when decisions are enforced on you without your say?
😤 If yes, it means you value autonomy — not just in tasks, but in ownership.
You want to know why, not just what.

3️⃣ Can you quit without a backup plan?
🧳 Have you ever resigned from a job even when you didn’t have another lined up — simply because you weren’t learning or growing?
That kind of risk-taking? It’s the foundation of entrepreneurship.

4️⃣ Have you ever left just because it didn’t excite you anymore?
🔥 Not because of money, manager, or promotion.
Just because the work didn’t spark anything inside. That inner compass? It matters more than any offer letter.

5️⃣ When you’re working, do you think like an employee or like an owner?
🏢 Do you care only about your tasks?
Or do you find yourself thinking about revenue, customers, brand, scale — even if it’s not your job?
That’s an early sign of a founder mindset.

6️⃣ Can you commit to a long, slow path?
📆 Building something meaningful takes time.
Are you okay waiting 10 years for it to take shape?
Or do you need instant progress?
Patience is a superpower in business.

7️⃣ Can you go from big salary to ₹0 — and still keep going?
💸 Would you put your savings on the line?
💰 Pull from your PF? Sell your house if needed?
That’s not desperation. That’s belief.
True entrepreneurs put skin in the game.

8️⃣ Are you okay with navigating the unknown?
🌫️ Business = uncertainty.
You won’t have clarity all the time.
But can you walk through the fog anyway — and still make decisions?
That’s courage.

9️⃣ Are you a natural salesperson?
🗣️ Business = constant selling.
You sell to your team, your customers, your investors, your co-founders.
If you hate selling — you’ll struggle to grow.
If you love it — you’ll thrive.

🔟 Can you fight when it matters?
⚔️ Can you escalate to the top when needed?
📢 Can you go against your boss, your process, the system — when you know something’s not right?
That’s not insubordination. That’s leadership.

⸻

These aren’t things you learn in B-school.
They’re lived.
They’re earned.
They reveal themselves over time.

The irony?
You’re already showing signs of who you are — every single day.
Just look closely.

🧭 When you look back — what do you see?

Are you wired to follow — or wired to build?
