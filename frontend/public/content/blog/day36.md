🎯 365 Days of Stories: Day 36 – The Wrong Co-Founder Can Slow You Down

When I started my first entrepreneurial journey, I was a solo founder. I often felt that having a co-founder would have made things easier.

So, when I decided to start my second venture, my top priority wasn’t the business idea—it was finding the right co-founder.

🔥 The Quick Agreement That Led to a Slow Realization
One day, I was catching up with a friend and ex-colleague who had just lost his job—not by choice, but due to post-COVID cost-cutting.

When he told me about his situation, I immediately asked:

👉 “Would you like to do business with me?”

Without hesitation, he replied: “Why not!”

I was excited but cautious.
I told him: “Let’s sit down and discuss everything first—our roles, responsibilities, equity, profits, and expectations.”

We met at a café and talked for four hours.
To my surprise, he didn’t ask many questions.
He simply said: “I’m fine, let’s get started.”

Something felt off.

Starting a business is a huge commitment, and not asking questions was a red flag. But I brushed it aside, thinking maybe he was just being flexible.

🚀 The Early Days: Me Talking, Him Listening
👉 We got a co-working space and spent the first few days getting to know each other—both personally and professionally.
👉 I shared a business idea: Providing premium IT services to mid-sized companies at a premium price—inspired by my time at ThoughtWorks.
👉 We aligned on company culture—wanting to build a boutique firm that prioritized quality over scale.

But soon, something became painfully clear.

For three weeks, I did all the thinking, strategizing, and planning.
He only asked questions based on what I presented—but never initiated ideas.

At first, I told myself, “Maybe he just needs more time.”
But after a month, I realized:

💡 I didn’t need an advisor—I needed a co-founder.

So, I brought it up. “I feel like I’m the only one driving this. I need you to contribute more.”

Instead of discussing it, he got offended and said, “Maybe we’re not the right fit.”
I suggested taking some time to figure things out, but he was done.

I gave him a week to reconsider, but he stood by his decision.

🏆 Lesson #1: The Wrong Co-Founder Is Worse Than No Co-Founder
❌ A co-founder is not just someone who agrees with you.
✅ A co-founder must bring fresh ideas, take ownership, and challenge you.
❌ Don’t look for a co-founder just because the journey is lonely.
