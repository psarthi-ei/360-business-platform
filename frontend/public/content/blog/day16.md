365 Days of Stories â€“ Day 16: Restructuring Teams & Aligning Priorities in a Crisis

Continuing from Day 15, where the CEO put payments on hold due to delays in high-priority projects, and I made the tough call to let go of 9 out of 11 managersâ€”the real challenge now was execution.

ðŸ”¹ Internal restructuring was the easy part. The real battle was delivering results.

Step 1: Identifying the Core Problems
We had two separate teams:
âœ” Development Team â€“ Senior experts focused on new projects.
âœ” Support Team â€“ Junior engineers handling production issues, often lacking system knowledge.

ðŸš§ The Issues:
ðŸ’¡ Production support was weak, causing customer frustration.
ðŸ’¡ Support teams depended on developers, but developers werenâ€™t accountable for production.
ðŸ’¡ BU leaders had their own prioritiesâ€”some focused on CEO-driven initiatives, others on production stability, and others on their business unit projects.

With 130+ engineers spread across 10-12 teams, misalignment was inevitable.

Step 2: Merging Development & Support Teams
To fix this, I took a bold step:

âœ… Merged Development & Support into one unit under a single Tech Lead per team.
âœ… Now, the right expertise was allocated where neededâ€”whether for fixing production issues or delivering new features.
âœ… This improved accountability and skill alignment, reducing dependency on developers for urgent fixes.

ðŸš€ Result: Production stability improved, but new development timelines were impacted.

Step 3: The Bigger Challenge â€“ Customer Priorities & Billing Issues
The customer contract followed "named resource billing", meaning:

âœ” Each engineer was assigned to a specific workstream and billed accordingly.
âœ” BU leaders had invoice approval authority and focused only on their projects.
âœ” Support engineers were billed monthly, but development engineers were billed per project.

ðŸš§ The problem?
ðŸ’¡ If a development engineer helped in support, their work wasnâ€™t billable.
ðŸ’¡ If a support engineer assisted in development, the invoice could be rejected.
ðŸ’¡ BU leaders rejected billing if engineers worked outside their assigned scope, creating constant conflicts.

Now, the real challenge was aligning leaders, billing structure, and priorities to make this model work.

ðŸ’¡ Have you ever faced a situation where resource allocation and priorities conflicted with customer expectations? How did you navigate it? Would love to hear your experiences! ðŸ‘‡
