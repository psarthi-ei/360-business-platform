365 Days of Stories – Day 5: The “Company” That Didn’t Exist

By now, I had accepted that finding a Cofounder & CTO was going to be difficult. No one from my network was ready to leave their stable, well-paying job to join me full-time.

So, I pivoted.
👉 Let’s hire freshers and build the product under my guidance.

But what happened next was something I never expected.

The Plan: Hiring Freshers from NCST

I decided to go to NCST, where I did my post-graduate course.

📌 NCST (National Centre for Software Technology) offered an extremely difficult course called FPGDST.
📌 The total intake was 160 students, but only 50% remained after 6 months due to the difficulty level.
📌 By the end, only 5-10% graduated.
📌 Even those who didn’t complete the course ended up in great careers—that’s how intense it was.

I thought, this is the best place to find solid freshers.

I met the Head of Placements, hoping to get access to students.

Then this conversation happened:

🔹 “What’s your company name?”
👉 “I haven’t decided yet.”

🔹 “Is it registered?”
👉 “No.”

🔹 “How many people in your company?”
👉 “Just me.”

🔹 “Is it funded?”
👉 “No.”

Then he said something that shattered my confidence:

“So, what do I tell my students? That an entrepreneur with no company, no funding, and no team wants to hire them?”

💔 That was brutal.

He refused to let me talk to the students. One month had already passed without a salary.

Reality Was Hitting Hard

By now, August had started.

📉 No Cofounder.
📉 No CTO.
📉 No team.
📉 No product development started.

My family started suggesting I go back to a job.

I considered freelancing, but then I asked myself:
“What can I even sell?”

🤷‍♂️ I was a management guy—I had spent 5 years leading teams, not writing code.
🤷‍♂️ Without a company, I had no team to manage.
🤷‍♂️ I couldn’t even earn ₹1 from freelancing because I had no technical skills left.

This was highly frustrating.

I decided—even if I go back to a job, I will return to tech.

A Moment of Frustration & Realization

I applied for technical jobs, and one interviewer asked me:
“How do you compare two strings?”

At that moment, it hit me—

📉 “What nonsense am I doing? I left a senior role to solve a global problem, and here I am, being tested on string comparison.”

This was absurd.

💡 Right then, I made a bold decision—

🚀 Forget hiring a team. Forget finding a Cofounder & CTO. I’ll build the product myself.

Next: Relearning Tech from Scratch

With zero coding practice for 5 years, I had to relearn everything from scratch.

How did I do it? That’s the story for tomorrow.

Have You Ever Felt Stuck?

Have you ever been in a situation where you felt completely stuck and had to restart from zero?
