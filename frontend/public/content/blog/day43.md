🚨 365 Days of Stories: Day 43 – Sales Is Hard. Really Hard.

When I started my technology consulting and services business, I was stuck on a basic but brutal question:

How do I reach the right people to pitch what I’m building?

Everyone had advice:

🗣️ “Go to meetups.”
👥 “Leverage your network.”
🎤 “Attend startup events.”

The idea was simple: sales happen when you meet people.

So I gave it a shot.

📍 I went to a startup meetup in Koramangala.

VCs were on stage.
Around 50 attendees — mostly in their early 20s.

And me? I felt completely out of place.

💭 The questions were too basic. The vibe felt off.
Great for someone starting their journey — not for someone in the middle of it.

To make it worse, someone even tried to sell me a current account.

I walked away frustrated. That was my first and last meetup.

🧠 So I went back to the drawing board.

I asked myself — who exactly am I trying to sell to?

I built my Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):

🎯 Founders & CEOs of mid-scale tech-driven companies (FinTech, HealthTech, AgriTech)
🏢 Company size: 200–1000 employees
👨‍💻 Engineering team: less than 100 people

Why them?

🔹 Tech is core to their business
🔹 But their engineering team is usually small
🔹 Their product works — but may struggle to scale or compete
🔹 And they value outside tech expertise because that’s not their strength

❓ Next question: Where do these people hang out?

Definitely not at meetups.
And even at large events, they’re on stage — not in the crowd.

🎪 Good events happen once a quarter in a city.
And even then, Founders & CEOs come to speak or meet investors — not take sales calls.

⏳ Time was money. I couldn't afford to wait 2–3 months for a shot.

💡 So I turned to LinkedIn.

Every founder and CEO is on LinkedIn.
And I could reach out — without waiting for an event invite.

I started sending personalised connection requests every day.

📬 3 months → 500+ connection requests
✅ 166 accepted (30% success rate)

But that was just the start.

📌 I followed up with every lead 4–5 times
📆 Over 6–8 weeks
📩 Across LinkedIn + email
📊 Every message tracked

😓 But the results?

Out of 150+ promising leads…
👉 Only 2 actual conversations.

It was painful.

⚠️ And that’s when I had to ask myself:

“If I’m doing all this and still not converting — am I solving a real problem?”

Here’s what I realised:

🔸 I was pitching tech consulting — something everyone offers
🔸 My messaging wasn’t cutting through the noise
🔸 And more importantly — my offer didn’t feel urgent or essential

To a busy founder, I probably looked like just another service provider in a crowded inbox.

They weren’t ignoring me.
They were ignoring one more generic pitch.

🔥 Lesson: Sales is hard — especially when your offer doesn’t sound urgent or unique.
You may be solving a real problem — but if the positioning is off, no one pays attention.

🎯 You only get a few seconds in someone’s inbox. Make them count.
