🚜 365 Days of Stories: Day 40 - If You’re Not Deeply Committed to the Problem, You’ll Quit Midway

During my second entrepreneurial journey, my co-founder and I were talking about what kind of business we wanted to build.

“It should be meaningful,” we agreed. “Purpose-driven. Impactful.”

That’s when he brought up an interesting issue:

“Some days tomato prices are sky-high, other days farmers throw them on the road. It’s madness.”

I asked — why?

He explained:

“It’s all supply-demand mismatch. When too many farmers grow tomatoes, prices crash. When few do, prices skyrocket. And frustrated farmers dump their crop.”

That got us thinking.

Tomato demand is fairly constant — people consume it daily.
So why does supply fluctuate?

The answer: No visibility.
Farmers make planting decisions based on guesswork.
If prices were good last season, everyone plants tomatoes.
Next thing you know — oversupply, prices crash, losses.

So we asked — what if we could fix the supply side with better forecasting?

We thought we’d hit a jackpot.

We dug deeper and found that a few agritech companies were already solving this — connecting farmers with consistent buyers and forecasting demand.

But they barely scratched the surface — maybe 0.1% of India’s farmers.

Plenty of room left. We were excited.

We even attended the Organic Millets trade fair in Bangalore, where hundreds of farmers had gathered.

But there, we hit a wall.

We realised we had zero domain knowledge.
We didn’t understand the context, the nuances, or even how to start building trust with farmers.

My co-founder, especially, felt strongly:

“We can’t pursue this. It’s a long, hard road. And we’re not equipped.”

And so, we dropped the idea.

Looking back, I sometimes wonder if we gave up too soon.

But one thing is clear:

👉🏽 If you’re not deeply committed to a problem, you won’t survive the journey.

💥 Lesson: If You’re Not Deeply Committed to the Problem, You’ll Quit Midway
✅ The problem should matter to you — deeply.
❌ You can’t fake purpose or passion.
✅ If the path is long (and it always is), only conviction will keep you going.

Have you ever dropped a promising idea because it didn’t pull you in enough?
Would love to hear your story. 👇
