365 Days of Stories – Day 49: “This is not our service, sir.”

My wife is trying to organise a Jagannath Yatra in our apartment.
She’s figured out the logistics, got the society’s approval, and even roped in a Pandit.

Only one thing is missing:
A Rath (chariot).
Without it, there’s no Yatra.

So I started searching online and stumbled upon a startup that helps organize pujas and rituals across India.

I called them.

“Are you a startup?”
“Yes.”
“Are you operational?”
“Yes.”
“What services do you offer?”
“We organize pujas, homams, rituals, etc.”
“Great! Can you help us arrange a Rath for a Jagannath Yatra?”
“That we don’t do.”

I tried to persuade him:
We live in a 1,500+ unit apartment in Electronic City — a massive crowd, perfect visibility.
I even said, “You can brand the Rath. This will give your startup great marketing”

He replied,
“We are already doing marketing, sir. Thank you. But this is not our service.”

I requested - bhai try to kar

His tone turned firm.
“No sir, this is not something we offer. If we come across anything, we’ll let you know. Thank you.”

Call ended.

I kept thinking about it afterward.

He wasn’t rude. Just very rigid.

But here’s the thing:
If you’re a startup founder, you don’t always know what business you’re in — until a customer shows you.

This wasn’t someone asking for a pizza at a pharmacy.
It was deeply adjacent to their core offering.

And it was a moment to create a unique experience for a family and community — and build real-world brand trust in the process.

It reminded me of a hard truth:

The biggest breakthroughs often come from adjacent needs — not core offerings.

The world doesn’t reward startups for saying,
“This is not our service.”
It rewards those who say,
“Let me figure that out for you.”

Sometimes the real business isn’t what you think you offer — it’s what your customer actually needs.
