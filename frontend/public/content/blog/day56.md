365 Days of Stories – Day 56: I Didn’t Write Code — But I Built More (with Claude Code)

I’m a founder and seasoned tech leader. I haven’t written production code in 4–5 years—yet my MVP is moving fast.

Why? I’m building with Claude Code. I don’t type code; I tell what needs to exist. The machine drafts it. My job isn’t to do the thing—it’s to say the thing precisely and make the right decisions.

🧭 How I build now

📝 Start with plain-English requirements: who it’s for, what “done” feels like, what must never break.
🧠 Ask for options & trade-offs: speed vs reliability, cost vs resilience, now vs later.
🏗️ Tighten architecture: clear boundaries, contracts, failure paths.
🧪 Enforce standards: tests, logs, naming, alerts—so correctness becomes boring.
🤝 Decide → constrain → verify: Claude Code writes; I think, articulate, verify.

🎯 What matters (more than ever)

🔎 Deep requirement understanding
🗣️ Crisp articulation so AI (and humans) build the right thing
📐 Architectural thinking with conscious trade-offs
📊 Observability & testing (prove it works on bad days, not just demo days)

What fades: 🧰 tool worship, ⚙️ framework trivia, 📚 memorizing APIs.

🔄 The big shift in “great developer”

For years, “great” meant acing DSA and patterns. Still useful—but no longer the definition.

Today, greatness =
👂 Grasp the business & name real constraints
🧩 Shape systems that fit outcomes and realities
🧾 Write acceptance criteria so clear the build becomes obvious
🛡️ Design for failure and real-world messiness
🧵 Tell the story (why this, why now, why not that)

You can be brilliant at algorithms and still be a poor builder if you can’t explain intent.
Conversely, if you frame outcomes and reason about trade-offs, you can ship great software—without typing every line.

✡️ How I review work (in the AI era)

❌ “Did we pick the coolest library?”
✅ “Is this the right shape for the problem—and will it hold up on a bad day?”
❌ Line-by-line obsession
✅ Review intent & invariants: contracts, failure paths, tests, observability

✍️ Coding today is telling, not typing

The computer does the keystrokes. We own clarity, decisions, and proof.

I’ll keep sharing notes as I build this MVP with Claude Code. I’m enjoying the shift—and if you love clear thinking more than clever syntax, you probably will too.

If you didn’t have to type the code, what would you get crystal-clear about first?
