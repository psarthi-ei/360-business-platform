💭 365 Days of Stories: Day 46 — The Loneliest Journey: Why Entrepreneurship Is Harder Than You Think

Entrepreneurship is hard — but the harder part?

👉 It’s facing the people around you when things aren’t working.

I left my job not because I had it all figured out, but because I felt stuck.
I wasn’t growing. I wasn’t learning.
I didn’t feel excited about what I was building.
So I stepped away to try and build something of my own. 🚶‍♂️💡

And that’s when the real challenge began.

Not just building. But explaining. 💬

📍 Explaining why you left job
📍 Explaining what you’re doing now
📍 Explaining how your business is doing
📍 Explaining your changing plans 
📍 Explaining what’s next 

And the truth is — most people around you genuinely care.
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Your parents. 💑 Your spouse. 🙍‍♀️🙎🏻‍♂️Your Brother and Sisters 🤝 Your close friends.
They’re not trying to pull you down.
They’re just... worried. 😟

They see you tired, uncertain, earning nothing 💸 — and their instinct is to protect you.
🗣️ “Maybe it’s time to go back to a job.”
🗣️ “You’ve tried enough.”
🗣️ “Why struggle when you’re so capable?”

And then there are others —
🤔 well-meaning colleagues, 👥 distant friends, 🧑‍💻 old acquaintances.
They ask: “What exactly are you doing these days?”

Some are curious.
Some are skeptical.
But beneath it all, everyone’s quietly trying to figure out:
Can you really make it? 🎯

It’s not malicious. But it’s heavy.
Because you start to feel alone. 😔

Like you’re the only one who chose the harder path,
and now you have to prove — to everyone — that it wasn’t a mistake. ⚖️

See, in a job, when you struggle, people say:
✅ “Don’t worry, it’ll get better.”
But in business, when you struggle, the message — spoken or unspoken — is often:
❌ “Maybe it’s time to stop.”

That’s the part no one tells you about:

😶 The loneliness.
🤯 The second-guessing.
🕵️ The feeling that you’re being quietly measured, every day.

But if there’s one thing I’ve learned over the last two years, it’s this:

The only way to figure it out… is to stay. 🛡️

No matter how hard it gets.
No matter how slow the wins come.
No matter how many times you think of going back. 🔁

Because this journey — as lonely as it feels — is also yours.
And staying in the game, even when it’s painful, is the only real shot you’ve got at building something that truly matters. 🧱🚀

💬 Have you felt this pressure from people around you while doing something unconventional? How do you deal with it? I’d love to hear your story.👇
