365 Days of Stories – Day 3: Cracking the Code for Carpooling

With my business idea finalized during my notice period—solving traffic congestion—the next challenge was:

💡 How do we solve it?

The three biggest barriers stopping people from carpooling were:
1️⃣ Trust – People don’t feel safe sharing rides with strangers.
2️⃣ Convenience – Finding a ride should be as easy as booking Uber/Ola
3️⃣ Privacy – Why would car owners share their personal space with others?

1. Solving the Trust Issue

The first and biggest challenge was trust.

I asked myself: Why do we trust someone?
👉 Because we either know them personally or they come recommended by someone we trust.

That’s when it hit me—what if we created a “Trust Network” for carpooling?

✅ Users could add their trusted people into groups.
✅ Rides would be matched only within their trust circle or extended network (2nd-degree connections, like LinkedIn).

This way, you wouldn’t be sharing a ride with a random stranger—you’d only connect with people trusted by someone you trust.

Trust? ✅ Solved.

2. Solving the Convenience Issue

This was easy.

Uber and Ola had already cracked real-time ride matching using live location tracking. We could apply the same approach to carpooling—rides should be available in minutes.

Convenience? ✅ Solved.

3. Solving the Privacy Issue – The Big Aha Moment

This was the hardest part.

Why would a car owner share a ride? Most carpooling platforms assumed the answer was money—saving fuel costs. But was that really enough?

I dug deeper into the psychology of car owners:
🚗 They earn ₹1L+ per month and own a ₹5-15L car—not just for transport, but as a lifestyle choice.
💰 Saving ₹2-4K on fuel isn’t a big enough incentive for them.
❌ They won’t compromise their privacy just to save a little money.

Then I flipped the question: What would make me, as a car owner, willingly share my ride?

I asked myself, Who would I genuinely enjoy sharing a ride with?

💡 If I could share my daily commute with new entrepreneurs, successful founders, investors, or mentors, I wouldn’t just be willing to give them a ride—I’d go out of my way to drop them off AND even pay for this opportunity!

This made me realize:

✔️ For different people, at different stages of life, their interests vary.
✔️ The key was to match riders based on shared interests, so they would actually enjoy the time spent in traffic.
✔️ Traffic wouldn’t feel like wasted time anymore—it would become an opportunity for meaningful conversations.

That was the missing piece—the biggest USP of my idea:

✅ Make carpooling about valuable connections, not money.

Privacy concern? ✅ Solved.

What next!!! Will share tomorrow.
