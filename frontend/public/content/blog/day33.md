🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 33 🌟 Chasing a Dream, One Apartment at a Time

Entrepreneurship is a journey full of trial, error, and growth. My Day 33 story is one of persistence, creativity, and invaluable lessons learned along the way.

After setting up multiple pickup zones with a proper display of the carpooling option, I focused my efforts on aggressively promoting my ride-sharing app within my apartment complex. What followed was a series of strategies designed to get neighbors on board with my ride-sharing app.

💡 Morning Hustle: From 7:30 AM to 10 AM, I pitched my product to commuters waiting at the main gate for their office or private cabs. The initial reception? Disheartening. Many ignored me, thinking I was just another salesperson. But I didn’t give up—I introduced myself as the founder of the startup and a fellow resident. This helped me grab attention, but meaningful conversations were scarce due to the morning rush.

🚗 Evening Pursuit: In the evenings, I approached car owners in the parking lot as they returned home. These interactions were slightly better—people had more time to listen. However, the spark of interest wasn’t enough to create momentum.

🏠 Door-to-Door Visits: Not one to back down, I took it further by visiting individual apartments on weekends. Starting with my block of 80 apartments (part of a larger complex with 1,500 homes), I spoke to neighbors personally. This yielded better results—some downloaded the app immediately, and a few showed enthusiasm. Yet, ride matches weren’t happening due to a lack of users. To make the system work, I realized I needed at least 100 active sign-ups in my block.

🎯 Incentives: To encourage daily ride-sharing—whether matches occurred or not—I launched a rewards program:

1️⃣ ✨ Free parking across Bangalore for offering 5 rides a week.
2️⃣ ⛽ 5% cashback on fuel for completing 20 rides a month.

I marketed these incentives enthusiastically on our residents’ Facebook group, hoping to spark daily activity. But after 3-4 months of effort, participation remained low, and the rewards weren’t enough to motivate sustained action.

🌟 Lessons Learned: Incentives alone weren’t enough to create lasting engagement. To truly ignite interest, I realized I needed a stronger pull and significant upfront investment to make ride-sharing irresistible—a bold leap I’m ready to take.

The journey continues as I prepare to take decisive action to turn my vision into reality. Stay tuned for the next chapter in my story.
