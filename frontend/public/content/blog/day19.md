365 Days of Stories â€“ Day 19: Navigating Internal Resistance & Earning CEOâ€™s Support

With in-person meeting issues resolved, we tackled another roadblockâ€”getting architects actively involved in development instead of just signing off on designs at the end.

Youâ€™ll remember that the customer CEO had frozen our payments, and my super boss had given me veto power to engage anyone within the organization to turn the project around.

Step 1: Architects Aligned, But Another Roadblock Emerged

Even though architects didnâ€™t report to me, I had full control to get them aligned. While there was initial resistance, their willingness to prioritize CEO-driven projects shifted their focus. They started contributing during development, not just in design approval.

ðŸš§ New Roadblock â€“ Process QA Team ðŸš§

Just when we thought we had momentum, another challenge surfaced. The Process QA team, responsible for enforcing SDLC compliance, wasnâ€™t happy that we were bypassing documentation and approval steps. We werenâ€™t ignoring qualityâ€”we were laser-focused on getting projects live ASAP.

I spoke to the Process QA leader, explaining the need for exceptions and parallel execution. He understood but asked for a formal email taking responsibility for these exceptions.

âœ” I agreed.
âœ” The Process QA team aligned.
âœ” We moved forward.

Step 2: The Next CEO Meeting â€“ Make or Break

A month passed. We had made significant progress, but none of the 10-15 high-priority projects had gone live yet. Some were in UAT, others stuck in customer design approvalsâ€”problems now on their side.

I knew the upcoming CEO review meeting was critical. This time, all BU leaders would be present. When stakes are high, never sugarcoat issues to the top decision-maker.

The Meeting Begins...
We presented our progress transparentlyâ€”where we made improvements and where projects were stuck. The CEO didnâ€™t just push usâ€”he challenged his own team too. He appreciated our progress, gave us direct access to escalate any issue, instructed everyone to prioritize these projects, and set up fortnightly meetings.

Step 3: The Real Impact â€“ Power & Resistance

With CEO backing, priority alignment, and clear escalation paths, the project was finally on track!

ðŸš§ But success comes with a price. ðŸš§
Internally and externally, not everyone was happy. Some saw us as problem solvers, but others saw us as troublemakers. Challenging the status quo made enemies.

Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ll talk about tomorrowâ€”the resistance we faced, both within our company and from the customerâ€™s side.
