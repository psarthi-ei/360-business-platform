365 Days of Stories – Day 4: The Shift from Tech to Business & The Search for a CTO

By this point, I had my problem statement and solution figured out—solving traffic congestion through a trust-based carpooling system. Now, the next big challenge was:

💡 How do I build the technology?

The Price of Moving Away from Tech

Until 2010, I was an extraordinary software engineer. But after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad in 2008, I became obsessed with the idea that I needed to either start a business or become a CEO.

Back then, my understanding was simple: Only management guys become CEOs, not tech people.

Between 2007-2010, I was traveling extensively for work—London, Amsterdam, Norway—working on global projects and experiencing different cultures.

But the more I thought about the future, the more I realized—I wanted to be on the business side of things.

When I returned to India in 2010, I told my manager:

🗣️ “I want to move into management. I want to be a CEO someday, and I don’t see how a technical guy can reach that level.”

He connected me to his skip-line boss, who gave me advice I’ll never forget:

💡 “There’s huge competition for every management role, but in technology, you may not become a CEO, but there are enough seats for great tech minds at least till IBM Distinguished Engineer—which is equally senior.”

But I wasn’t convinced. I said, “I want to be a CEO, please help me move into management.”

Since I was a top performer, he somehow managed a business development role for me.

Looking back, I wonder why he helped me?

Maybe he saw that I was a different kind of guy—someone bold enough to say this early in my career.

Because the role he gave me in sales was not easy—it was a high-pressure, sink-or-swim role. Maybe he thought, Let him prove himself here!

For the next five years, I was completely out of tech.

But now, in 2015, when it came to implementing my startup idea, I felt helpless.

Tech had moved so fast that I felt handicapped.

The Hunt for a Cofounder & CTO

I started looking for a Cofounder & CTO to implement my idea.

Meanwhile, my last salary was credited in June, and by July, the reality hit—
⏳ Time was ticking.
💰 I had only 10 months of savings.
🏡 I had promised my family that no one’s lifestyle would change—even if I had to sell my flat.

I called up all my friends—people in well-settled careers, earning good money, with home loans and kids.

Reality check:
❌ No one was crazy enough to leave their job to join me.
❌ I needed a full-time Cofounder & CTO.
❌ But I didn’t have money to hire a senior guy.

After multiple rejections, I decided—
👉 Let’s hire freshers and build the product under my guidance.

How? Stay tuned
