365 Days of Stories – Day 52: Moonlighting — Survival or Betrayal?

I had an intense conversation today with a very senior professional. We were talking about the rising trend of moonlighting, and more importantly, why it's no longer just a choice — it’s becoming a necessity.

Think about it.

We’re living in a time where employment is no longer guaranteed. Especially in IT and private sectors, even senior professionals are being told during appraisals:

“You should be thankful you even have a job.”

Layoffs are becoming routine — across the US and increasingly in India.
And it’s not about performance. It’s about markets, cost cuts, AI disruptions, or simply… “restructuring.”

Now, let’s flip this.

If employers are under no obligation to ensure long-term employment,
then why are employees expected to remain single-loyal, dependent, and obedient?

Shouldn't we, as professionals, create backup plans, build side gigs, learn new skills, or even take up second projects (ethically, of course)?

Why is it considered betrayal to safeguard your own livelihood?

I’m not promoting conflict of interest or dishonesty.
If you’re hired to work 9 to 5 — give your best. Deliver. Be professional.
But what you do from 6 to 11, or over weekends, is your time.

I think moonlighting is no longer a fringe practice. It’s becoming a quiet revolution.

As a mentor, we should be encouraging people to take up multiple roles, build side income, or grow personal brands.

This isn’t greed. This is survival.
It’s planning ahead in a world that gives no second chances.

We need to stop vilifying moonlighting and start having an honest conversation:

In a world with zero job security, do employees not have the right to secure their own future?

And yes, companies can — and should — define guardrails like no conflict of interest, data confidentiality, etc. But a blanket ban on working outside your job? That’s outdated thinking.

Would love to hear your take —
Are you for moonlighting? Against it? Or somewhere in between?

Let’s talk.
