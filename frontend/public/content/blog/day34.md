ðŸš€ 365 Days of Stories: Day 34 ðŸŒŸ When Numbers Speak Louder Than Dreams

Entrepreneurship, they say, is a rollercoaster. Itâ€™s thrilling, exhausting, and sometimes humbling. My Day 34 story is a deep dive into the realities of turning dreams into viable business modelsâ€”and how the numbers often hold the final verdict.

After experimenting with multiple strategies to encourage car owners to offer rides regularly on my ride-sharing platform, I faced an undeniable truth: none of them had yielded the results I had hoped for. The incentives werenâ€™t enticing enough, and the engagement remained lackluster. This prompted me to step back, put my emotions aside, and approach the problem analytically. I decided to run the numbersâ€”calculating the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Lifetime Value (LTV) of my customers to evaluate whether the business could truly be viable.

ðŸ’¡ The Strategy: I came up with an idea to partner with 3M for free car interior cleaning in exchange for users downloading the app and committing to a minimum number of rides per month. With a general cleaning cost of â‚¹1500, I estimated that I could negotiate a bulk deal for â‚¹1000 per car if I signed on 200 cars.

ðŸ”¢ The Math:

LTV = â‚¹60/month/customer x 12 months = â‚¹720.

CAC for one apartment complex = 200 cars x â‚¹1000 = â‚¹20L. Even with a year of operations, I projected a 30% lossâ€”a significant â‚¹6L deficit. The numbers were clear: at the unit economics level, the business wasnâ€™t viable.

ðŸ’¼ The Turning Point: Despite the discouraging math, I decided to give it one last try. I applied to NSRCEL at IIM Bangalore, where I had an exploratory meeting with an incredible 85-year-old mentor, Mr. Mehta. When I asked how I could secure funding, he offered me this wisdom: "The world has changedâ€”no one invests in ideas anymore. Show repeat customers for 6 months, and investors will follow."

However, achieving this would require self-investmentâ€”â‚¹20L for 200 repeat customers over 6 months. Though he offered incubation at NSRCEL, I politely declined, as I needed funding more than guidance.

ðŸ¤” The Hard Choice After days of deliberation, I faced one of the toughest decisions of my life. I could either invest â‚¹20L of my own money to give Parift another chance, knowing I might lose â‚¹6L within a year, or close the business and walk away. Ultimately, I couldnâ€™t justify the loss, and I made the heartbreaking decision to shut down Parift Ride, my first entrepreneurial venture.

ðŸ’¡ The Takeaway: Shutting Parift was not the endâ€”it was an invaluable learning experience. I realized I needed to deepen my understanding of business dynamics and decided to join a small startup to learn how seasoned entrepreneurs navigate challenges.

Thatâ€™s how Parift Ride came to an end, but the lessons I learned have stayed with meâ€”and theyâ€™ve been worth every challenge I faced.

Have you ever had to shut down something close to your heart after putting in significant effort? I would love to hear your story.
