🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 38 – The Best Cofounder Might Be the One Who Says No

In recent years, the IT industry has been going through a slowdown. With growing cost pressures, the first ones to be impacted are often the senior, highly paid professionals.

That’s how I came across a few friends—seasoned, highly capable folks—who suddenly found themselves out of a job.

I saw this as an opportunity.
Maybe one of them could be my next co-founder.

💬 One conversation stood out.
He had great domain expertise (not in a space I was actively exploring, but still impressive).
More importantly, he was a great communicator—someone I thought could be a natural salesperson.
That was the complementary skill I was looking for.

So I pitched the idea of partnering up.

He appreciated it but said:

“I’m currently looking for a job, so I can’t commit full-time. But I can help on a part-time basis.”

I was clear:
❌ No part-time founders.
✅ Business is hard, and it needs full-time commitment from Day 1.

⏳ Fast forward 5-6 months...
He still hadn't landed a job.
This time, he was open to exploring a full-time partnership.

But I didn’t want this to be a casual trial.
So I laid it out clearly—

“Building a startup requires intense commitment. You need to be all in. For me, this is my second entrepreneurial journey, so I know what it takes—it’s an easy call. But for you, it’s the first time, so please think this through carefully.”

“Also, talk to your wife. Without family support, you can’t last long in this journey.”

He appreciated the honesty.
Took a few days.
Then came back and said:

“After thinking deeply… I don’t think I can commit to this journey. It’s too demanding, and I’m not ready for that level of effort. I’d rather wait for a job to come through.”

I respected that answer.
Because he didn’t say yes just to escape unemployment.
He was self-aware enough to know what he wanted from life.

And guess what?
A year later, he did land a job—something he was more comfortable with.

🧠 Lesson #3: The Best Co-founder Might Be the One Who Says No
✅ A thoughtful “no” is more valuable than a careless “yes.”
❌ Don’t choose a co-founder just because they’re available.
🚩 Someone who agrees too quickly without understanding the grind is a red flag.
💡 The person who turns you down today might become the right co-founder later, when the timing—and mindset—is right.

What qualities do you think are non-negotiable in a co-founder?
