365 Days of Stories – Day 50 — This Isn’t Just a Building. It’s Our Grandparents’ House

We have a piece of ancestral land in Patna — in the heart of the city.
Not just a plot. It carries stories. Emotion. Legacy.

We live in Bangalore now, but after years of thinking, we decided to build a house on that land. Not an apartment complex. Not flats for rent.
A house.

A home where we visit with joy.
Where my kids can say, “This is our grandparents’ house.”
Where memories can be made — not just investments.

But in Patna, that’s an odd dream.
The default mindset is: If you’ve got land, maximize it. Build four floors, rent out three, stay in one. It’s a math equation — ROI over emotion.

Still, I stuck to my conviction and started my search for an architect.
And I found one — very senior, very established. NIT graduate. Practicing for 30+ years. A well-known name in the city.
We got talking, created a rough plan. But something didn’t sit right. He wasn’t getting me. My vision.

Then came another senior guy. Even more seasoned. Looked at the plan and said, “It’s fine. You shouldn’t change anything.”
Again, I felt unheard.

Then, a friend referred a young architect. Not very “established.”
Didn’t have a fancy office — just a makeshift space on the ground floor of an apartment.
Not from a top college. Not even known for designing residential homes.

I went in with low expectations.

But I walked out sold.

He listened.
He understood why this home mattered.
He said something I’ll never forget:

“You want a house, not a set of flats. You have land — use it for what you feel, not what the market tells you.”
He suggested a garden. Thoughtfully planned space.
He brought in landscaping — a word most builders in Patna would laugh at.

It wasn’t about how many buildings he had designed.
It was about the alignment.

That day I decided: I’m going ahead with him.
Not because of degrees. Not because of reputation.
Because he cared and had the hunger to make something meaningful.

And that brings me to a broader point — about hiring, teams, startups, and life.

We often chase people with the “right” tick marks:
Fancy colleges. Big company logos. Decades of experience.

But sometimes, the best fit comes from those who aren’t yet famous.
They’re raw, real, and ready to prove themselves.
They listen deeply. Build passionately. Care genuinely.

I learned this while trying to build a house.
But it’s just as true in the boardroom.

Don’t just hire resumes.
Hire hunger.
