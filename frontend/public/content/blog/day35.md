🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 35 – Should You Leave a Job Without Clarity on What's Next?

In the last 10 years, I have changed 5 jobs. Except for one, I left every single one without having a clear plan for what’s next.

The only thing I knew?
❌ This job wasn’t working for me, and I was unhappy.

Was it the right decision? I don’t know.
But I can tell you this—every time I sat in an interview, my career stories got more attention than my engineering leadership skills.

🎯 The Interview That Changed My Perspective
Take my interview for Aadhaar (UIDAI - Govt. of India) as Head of Technology.
I was sitting across two of the greatest minds—Pramod Varma & Vivek Raghavan—for an hour-long conversation.

For the first 30 minutes, we discussed my experience leading teams and building technology. Then my entrepreneurial journey with Parift Ride came up.

Dr. Pramod immediately asked,
💡 "Why didn’t you talk about this earlier?"

I hesitated and said,
🛑 "It wasn’t a successful venture, so I wasn’t sure if it was relevant."

His response?
✅ "It’s one of the best things anyone can do—it shows courage and a determination to solve great problems."

The next 30 minutes were all about my entrepreneurial journey. I walked out of that room with the job.

🔥 Bold Decisions Set You Apart
Looking back, I realize one thing—what set me apart in interviews wasn’t just my engineering leadership skills, but the bold decisions I made throughout my career:

➡️ Leaving jobs without a plan, simply because I knew they weren’t right for me.
➡️ Turning around critical projects by making high-stakes decisions when things were on the edge.
➡️ Venturing into entrepreneurship multiple times, despite the uncertainty.

Every bold decision added to my story—one that interviewers found far more compelling than a list of skills on my résumé.

💭 Final Thought
So, should you leave a job without knowing what’s next?
🔹 If you have clarity on what you don’t want, that’s sometimes enough.
🔹 If you can make bold moves, opportunities will follow.
🔹 And if nothing else—you’ll have stories worth telling.
