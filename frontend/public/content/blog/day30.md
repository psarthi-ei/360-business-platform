🚀 365 Days of Stories: Day 30 - When I Took My Startup to the Streets—Literally!

After launching my ride-sharing app, I quickly realized one harsh truth:
👉 Without enough users, no rides would ever get matched.

I needed to market my product. But there was a BIG problem…

❌ No capital for paid ads.
❌ No experience in digital marketing.
✅ But I had determination—and that was enough to start!

🎯 The Hustle Begins: Selling on the Streets

Within 2-3 days, I hit the ground running.
📍 First stop: Inorbit Mall, Whitefield (Bangalore).

I dropped my wife at work and walked into the mall, ready to pitch my app.

But…
😬 I felt awkward stopping strangers.
😵 I had no idea how to start conversations.

Still, I tried.
👥 Me: “Do you have a few minutes?”
🚶‍♂️ People: “It’s about what?”
⏳ Them: “Sorry, I’m getting late.”

I quickly realized that one-on-one pitching wasn’t working.

🧠 Strategy Shift: Targeting Groups

Instead of chasing individuals, I started looking for groups—especially outside restaurants.
I walked up and said:
👉 "Hey guys, do you mind if I take a few minutes of your time?"

I pitched my product, handed out pamphlets, and asked them to download the app.

But after days of hustling, the results were disappointing:
❌ Few downloads.
❌ Even fewer ride requests.
❌ And still—no ride matches!

🔄 Adapting Again: Moving to IT Parks

I realized:
🕛 Malls only had crowds during lunch.
🛍️ Families & couples weren’t interested in interruptions.

So, I switched locations. My next stop?
🏢 ITPL – a massive software park.

🔥 The Smoker’s Pitch

I found my audience in smoking zones & tea stalls:

Mornings & afternoons: Talking to individuals in smoking areas.

Evenings: Approaching groups over tea.

This time, I refined my pitch. Instead of asking them to download, I asked for feedback.

💡 Key Realizations:
1️⃣ Ride seekers were mostly bus & two-wheeler commuters.
2️⃣ Car owners didn’t see a big reason to offer rides.
3️⃣ Everyone kept asking:
👉 "How is this different from QuickRide, SRide, etc.?"

And no matter what I said, my USP wasn’t clicking.

❓ The Big Questions That Kept Me Up at Night

1️⃣ How do I make car owners excited about sharing rides?
2️⃣ How do I finally get a ride matched—after one whole month?

I knew I had to think differently and tweak my product.

And that’s exactly what I did next… (I’ll share that tomorrow!)
