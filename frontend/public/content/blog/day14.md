365 Days of Stories – Day 14: Turning Performance Challenges into a Competitive Advantage

During the process automation engagement, our team consisted of 20+ members, including both senior and junior engineers, alongside customer developers working with us.

One day, the customer program manager pointed out an issue:

📌 Only a few people were delivering strong output.
📌 Some customer team developers were performing better than our own team.
📌 The team’s productivity was uneven—why, and how do we fix it?

Since we were chasing an aggressive goal of automating 240 processes in a short time, we needed a solution fast.

Gamifying the Challenge – A Cricket-Inspired Dashboard

My counterpart in the customer team was a big cricket fan. He suggested:

💡 “Why don’t we create a dashboard like a cricket scoreboard—showing our current run rate and the required run rate to win?”

It made complete sense!
✔ We had a fixed end date.
✔ We had a clear target (240 processes).
✔ We could track progress like a match run rate.

🚀 The Idea:
We built a real-time dashboard showing:
✔ Current vs. required automation rate
✔ Individual performance scorecards
✔ Pipeline visibility—who’s contributing to each stage

Since automation required multiple steps—Business Requirements → Tech Implementation → UAT → Go Live—this dashboard tracked every stage transparently.

📊 For the customer team, it showed broad progress.
📊 For the tech team, it provided detailed insights & accountability.

The Power of Transparency & Healthy Competition

🚀 The Impact:
✔ Developers started competing to top the leaderboard.
✔ Pipeline blockages became visible instantly.
✔ Everyone felt accountable for hitting the overall goal.

💡 The result? We achieved the milestone ahead of schedule!

🎯 The MD was thrilled, and this project turned into a reference success story for the company.

Key Takeaways from This Experience

💡 1. Strong customer partnership & transparency can turn around failing projects.
💡 2. Gamifying goals can boost team motivation & performance.
💡 3. Visibility & accountability drive execution—when teams see the goal, they step up.
