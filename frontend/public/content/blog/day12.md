365 Days of Stories â€“ Day 12: The Coding Marathon & The Harsh Reality of Entrepreneurship

With design and core algorithms in place, I started coding on 30th Oct 2015.

For the next 3 months, I worked day and night, and by 31st Jan 2016, I had:
âœ… Complete backend code
âœ… All carpooling use cases implemented
âœ… System divided into three core domains:

Ride â€“ Managing rides and requests
User â€“ Handling registration, preferences, and connections
Billing â€“ Generating ride invoices
ðŸš€ By this point, the backend was fully functional. I tested APIs using Postman and built a basic web frontend to validate everything.

I was thrilled! But reality hit hard.

The Financial Strain & The Road Ahead
By now, I had burned through 7 months of savings with no salary.

I sat down to evaluate:
ðŸ’¡ If backend took 5 months (learning + coding), how long for mobile app?
ðŸ’¡ Then 6-12 months to acquire customers?
ðŸ’¡ Can I sustain without income for another 1-2 years?

I had zero experience in mobile app development, and though I was confident in learning, I felt drained, alone, and mentally exhausted.

From Feb 2016, I started borrowing money from my mother to manage daily expenses. Thatâ€™s when reality struckâ€”I couldnâ€™t afford to stay afloat for another year.

ðŸ’¡ I had to make a tough call.

The Decision to Go Back to a Job
By March 2016, after 1 year since resigning from IBM, I made a tough decision:

âœ” Return to the corporate world

ðŸ’¡ With this, my first entrepreneurial journey was put on hold, and I stepped back into corporate life.

Have You Ever Faced a Moment Where Passion Clashed With Reality?
