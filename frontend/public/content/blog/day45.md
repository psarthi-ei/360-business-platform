🚨 365 Days of Stories: Day 45 — The Weight of Titles

In today’s job market, heavy job titles feel heavier than ever.

At small companies, everyone is Director, VP, or Head of Something — but often, the experience doesn’t match the title.

Meanwhile, senior leaders from large companies with real experience struggle to get shortlisted for interviews.

Why?

Is experience no longer valued? 
Were their skills only relevant inside their old company? 
Or is AI, cost pressure, reshaping the market?

I don’t have all answers, but here’s what my journey taught me.

🔹 2012 — IBM.
My first fancy title: Business Development Leader for IBM Worklight India.

IBM had just acquired Worklight for $70M. Many tech services company wanted to partner with us. Mobile was hot, and I was in the middle.

At a big event in Singapore, people exchanged cards with me like I was the next big thing. I believed I was calling the shots.

It was my first sales role.

Coming from a tech background, leadership thought a techie selling would do better than traditional sales. It was an experiment — I was the subject.

After a year with no big revenue, I was asked to move on.

It stung.

After being a top individual contributor, I thought I was a natural at sales — at least in my mind.

This was my first major career setback. I learned belief without results doesn’t matter.

🔹 Next: Delivery Project Executive for one of IBM’s top global accounts.

I managed ~140 people across cities.

Here’s the truth: I never climbed the traditional ladder. No first-line or senior manager first — I jumped straight into a senior role.

Sometimes, being an insider helps land roles at any level. Most leadership roles need common sense, confidence, and connection—not rocket science.

⏳ The role wasn’t easy.

Too many leaders from India and US managed the account. I struggled for almost a year to find where I could make an impact.

I asked tough questions about accountability.

Due to cost pressures, a reorg forced a decision: either India or US would lead — not both. 

I had to move out of the role, and that’s when the next role came up.

🔹 The next role? Leading a small team of 10-15 people.

It felt like a demotion.

I escalated it internally and heard: “Don’t look at team size, look at impact.”

Back then, it felt like an excuse.

Frustrated and craving meaning, I left IBM.

I spent months trying to earn independently.

Then came the biggest realization:

Without a company, titles mean nothing.

You can’t earn if your value doesn’t translate outside a system.

I stopped valuing fancy titles, team size, or reports.

What matters is:

🔸 What value do I bring?
🔸 What impact can I create — with or without a title?

Since then, I’ve carried many heavy titles but don’t take pride in them.

⚛️ Titles don’t define you. Impact does.

Stop chasing meaningless metrics like team size or designation.

☸️ What matters is: Can you move the needle? Create value? Solve real problems?
