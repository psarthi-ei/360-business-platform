            <p className={styles.problemIntro}>
              Technology can elevate everyone's life significantly. But from factories in Coimbatore 
              to workshops in Rajkot, India's 6 crore+ MSMEs ‚Äî the backbone of our economy ‚Äî are 
              still running on broken systems.

                <h3>Cost Barriers</h3>
                <p>
                  MSMEs don't have money to invest in expensive enterprise technology. 
                  Most CRM, ERP, and CXM solutions are priced for large companies, 
                  not small manufacturers trying to grow.

                <h3>Complexity Barriers</h3>
                <p>
                  Enterprise products require significant IT awareness to use effectively. 
                  Small manufacturers don't have dedicated IT teams ‚Äî they need solutions 
                  as simple as WhatsApp.

                <p>
                  Sales tracked in diaries. Inventory in someone's head. Procurement over calls. 
                  Invoices delayed. Payments missed. No visibility, no integration, no control.

              <h3>The Current Reality</h3>
              <p>
                Most MSMEs juggle pen and paper, Excel sheets, WhatsApp groups, and disconnected 
                silo tools. There's no single system that understands their language, their 
                workflows, or their cost constraints.

            <div className={styles.journeyText}>
              <p>
                The concept of "passion" used to puzzle me for years. I often questioned what I truly cared 
                about until I realized it's about doing what I love and excel at, so much so that time becomes 
                irrelevant. With 10-12 hours of our day spent at work, finding joy in what we do isn't just 
                important‚Äîit's essential. Happiness, after all, relies on both physical health and mental well-being.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                For me, mental happiness comes from immersing myself in activities I love. This realization 
                became the catalyst for my second entrepreneurial journey. Though I learned a lot from the 
                corporate world, I always felt constrained. I knew I could do more, solve great problems, 
                and make my life more exciting. You have to weigh the pros and cons of easy money against 
                the constraints of a job. That's when I decided to follow my heart‚Äîto pursue freedom and 
                happiness by tackling challenges that inspire and excite me.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In my first venture, I set out to solve the problem of traffic congestion with a carpooling 
                solution. While I addressed challenges like privacy and convenience, customer acquisition 
                proved to be a formidable hurdle, ultimately leading to the closure of the venture. However, 
                the lessons I gained from that experience have been invaluable, shaping my approach at ElevateIdea.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As I continue on this journey, I am inspired by India's rapidly evolving landscape‚Äîwhere 
                entrepreneurs thrive and technology drives transformation. I remain dedicated to helping 
                businesses unlock their full potential by overcoming technology barriers and driving 
                meaningful growth through innovation.
